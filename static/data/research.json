    "description": "MITH hosted the first annual Digital Humanities Winter Institute (DHWI), from Monday, January 7, 2013, to Friday, January 11, 2013, at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. We were delighted to be expanding the model pioneered by the highly-successful Digital Humanities Summer Institute ([DHSI](http://www.dhsi.org/)) at the University of Victoria to the United States.\nDHWI provided an opportunity for scholars to learn new skills relevant to different kinds of digital scholarship while mingling with like-minded colleagues in coursework, social events, and lectures during an intensive, week-long event located amid the many attractions of the Washington, D.C. region.\nCourses were open to all skill levels and catered to many different interests. For the 2013 Institute we assembled an amazing group of instructors who taught everything from introductory courses on project development and programming, to intermediate level courses on image analysis, teaching with multimedia, and data curation. DHWI also featured more technically-advanced courses on text analysis and linked open data. Our goal was that the curricula we assembled would appeal to graduate students, faculty, librarians, and museum professionals as well as participants from government and non-governmental organizations.\nAn exciting program of extracurricular events accompanied the formal DHWI courses to capitalize on the Institute’s proximity to the many cultural heritage organizations in the region. This stream of activities, which we called “DHWI Public Digital Humanities,” included an API workshop, a hack-a-thon, and opportunities to contribute videos and other materials to the [4Humanities](http://humanistica.ualberta.ca/) campaign to document the importance of the humanities for contemporary society.\nBoth the outward-looking DHWI Public Digital Humanities program and the week of high-caliber, in-depth digital humanities coursework were kicked off by the Institute Lecture. This year’s speaker was Seb Chan, Director of Digital & Emerging Media at the Smithsonian, Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in New York City.\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\nPlease note that beginning in 2014, DHWI became [Humanities Intensive Learning + Teaching](http://mith.umd.edu/community/dh-events/event/hilt-2014/). A limited subsection of the [original DHWI site](http://web.archive.org/web/20130304142829/http://mith.umd.edu/dhwi) is still available as archived on the Wayback Machine.\n",

The focal point of our inquiry is the so-called \"imitation\" Mass, a Renaissance musical genre notable for the ways in which its composers derived new, large-scale works from pre-existing ones. This rich weave of relationships seems particularly suited to the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) XML standard that serves as the basis of our digital editions, and for the enhanced capabilities of addressing scores with pinpoint accuracy developed during two recent projects supported by the NEH, The [Lost Voices Project](http://digitalduchemin.org/) (2010--2014) and MITH's [Enhancing Music Notation Addressability](../enhancing-music-notation-addressability/index.html) (2014--2015). We will extend addressability to various para-texts that give meaning to the musical citations themselves via a participatory multi-author publication system using Linked Open Data technologies such as the [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) and [Nanopublications](http://nanopub.org/wordpress/).\n",

    "description": "This web-based language learning project is alternately referred to as _Development of Russian Language Modules to Support Differentiated Learning and Generate Empirical Data on Student Performance_. It was developed by 2001 MITH Faculty Fellow, Professor Maria Lekic from Asian and East European Languages and Cultures.\n\nThe project involved the teaching and analysis of adult foreign language acquisition within relatively unscripted naturalistic settings through the design of computerized modules for individual or classroom involving specialized vocabularies (such as Russian for business use, space science, etc.). Working with MITH's programmer and technical staff at the American Councils for International Education (ACTR), Dr. Lekic developed a testbed of interactive tools that substantially advance language acquisition online tutorials.\n\nThe Business Russian project initially developed fourteen Internet-accessible Russian language learning modules- four beginner-level modules, six intermediate-level modules, and four advanced-level module -- plus a module on the Cyrillic alphabet. The modules could be used as a complement to a standard second or third-year Russian course or as stand-alone one-semester courses in Business Russian. The web-based Business Russian Modules included sets of self-paced practice activities that developed what are referred to in the literature as the \"enabling skills\" of grammar and vocabulary. These relied, in turn, on two basic texts, one written and one oral, which enhance reading and listening proficiency.\n\nAll of Lekic's activities on the Business Russian project before, during and after her fellowship led to the formation of Russnet, a Russian-Language field resource center which provides Russian-language learning services and products -- information, language modules, courses, materials, in-service teacher training, databases, discussion forums, and gateways to other Russian language resources.\n",

Rosemarie is a renowned scholar in what is now a very established Disability Studies field, and the DISC project was an outgrowth of her very early work starting in the mid-90's attempting to establish this as a legitimate academic field of study. The DISC site was an international, interdisciplinary, user-generated, digital forum providing support, collegial networks, and information that sustains a disability studies academic community and promotes disability studies in a humanities focus. DISC was in part built by the disability studies community through crowdsourced contributions of information.\nSite components included resources such as syllabi and speakers banks, a directory of scholars, publishing and job/grant opportunities, and directory of Disability Studies programs. It also included a searchable archive for the DS-HUM list serv, information on disability legislation, links to professional organizations, museums and exhibits.\n",

It was a national bestseller, and met with wide acclaim from _The New York Times_, _The Wall Street Journal_, _The Boston Globe_, _Salon_, _The Guardian_, _The Economist, The Independent, Kirkus Reviews, Bookforum, Scientific American, New Scientist, Brain Pickings, Ars Technica, Science News_ and many others. Blum discussed _Tubes_ with Terry Gross on NPR's _Fresh Air_; BBC 4 presented it as a \"Book of the Week\"; and Blum spoke about his research on the stages of TED Global and the London School of Economics, among dozens of other venues. Design Observer named Tubes its 2012 \"Book of the Year,\" and London's Independent called it \"The year's most stimulating and original 'travel' book.\" When the Edward Snowden/NSA revelations made the Internet's infrastructure a vital diplomatic question, journalists from Washington to London to Frankfurt to São Paulo relied on _Tubes_ as a crucial reference. It has been translated into nine languages.\n_Co-Sponsored by Design | Cultures + Creativity and the Department of American Studies_\n",

          "Stephanie develops, coordinates and implements digital research projects which foster collaborations between MITH and other library, archival, or cultural heritage organizations. This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of iotaCenter, a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions."

    "description": "The documentary was a project of 2003-04 MITH Fellow Regina Harrison. It depicts miners in Potosi, Bolivia, who extract silver, zinc, and lead from the mountain in the same precarious conditions as their ancestors did five centuries ago. Tourist agencies and transnational mining companies promise to bring in additional revenue for the miners, but it is apparent that the 'rich' mountain is dying.\n\nFor this work Harrison received the Latin American Studies Association 2006 \"Award of Merit in Film,\" which is given for \"excellence in the visual presentation of educational and artistic materials on Latin America.\" Harrison is also the recipient of book awards from the Modern Language Association and the Latin American Studies Association.\n\nThe project was filmed with the MITH Canon GL1 digital camera in 2003 and 2004, but the 2004 digital cassettes were stolen in Bolivia after three weeks of filming. Despite this setback, she then bought her own Canon GL2 to return to the labyrinth of mine tunnels to film again in 2005. Harrison, as a MITH fellow, received training in film technique from MITH fellow April Householder and from MITH Advisory Board member Irvin Kershner. Campus funding from CAPA, MITH, and ARHU DRI funds, as well as maintenance funds from Fulbright-Hays, helped defray the costs of several years of travel, filming, and editing.\n",

Mellon Foundation, Project Bamboo is a partnership of ten research universities building shared infrastructure for humanities research. Led by University of California, Berkeley, the project includes Australian National University; Indiana University; Northwestern University; Tufts University; University of Chicago; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; University of Maryland; University of Oxford; and University of Wisconsin-Madison. Within Bamboo, MITH is leading Corpora Space. We are designing research environments where scholars may discover, analyze and curate digital texts across the 450 years of print culture in English from 1473 until 1923, along with the texts from the Classical world upon which that print culture is based. We are initially focusing on the following collections: AUSTLit; Nineteenth-century Scholarship Online (NINES); Google Books; HathiTrust; Oxford Text Archive; Perseus Digital Library; and Text Creation Partnership of Early English Books Online (EEBO) and Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO).\n",

    "description": "Topic Modeling for Humanities Research was a unique opportunity for cross-fertilization, information exchange, and collaboration between and among humanities scholars and researchers in natural language processing on the subject of topic modeling applications and methods. The workshop was organized into three primary areas:\n1. an overview of how topic modeling is currently being used in the humanities;\n2. an inventory of topic modeling methods that have particular relevance for humanities research questions; and\n3. a discussion of software implementations, toolkits, and applications.\nThe workshop was designed to foster collaboration between these communities by providing humanities scholars with a deeper understanding of latent variable modeling methods (and best practices for their interpretation), and by articulating fundamental literary and historical questions for researchers outside of the humanities who are developing the models and methods. The organizers encouraged applications from faculty, staff, and graduate students, as well as other academics and members of the general public with a serious interest in natural language processing, topic modeling, and the literary and historical questions that intersect with these research areas. Confirmed speakers include: Matthew Jockers of the University of Nebraska, David Mimno of Princeton University, Rob Nelson of the University of Richmond, Jordan Boyd-Graber of the University of Maryland, and more.\n",

    "description": "The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities and the Theatre Department at the University of Maryland in College Park worked together in 2009-10 to create CAMP, a Collaborative, Ajax-Based, Modeling Platform. As the name suggests, this tool is an open source, collaborative, 3-dimensional modeler that will allow users with very little experience to generate a 3-dimensional model in their web browser which they can then allow other users to both view and edit. The tool was initially used to construct an international database of pre-nineteenth century theater buildings, but was designed to be intentionally generic so that scholars interested in structures of any sort can easily port it into their own projects.\n\nCAMP is innovative in its web-based, collaborative approach to 3-dimensional modeling, a difficult activity for which there are few tools in or outside of the digital humanities. Until about ten years ago, the average home computer could only process multimedia files relatively slowly, and file sizes and bandwidth speeds prevented the web from being a feasible platform for working with anything other than text and small images. These technical constraints have now largely vanished; however, work in the digital humanities has yet to catch up with the technical possibilities. The digital humanities remain a largely text-centric field in which most of the largest and best-funded projects in are still those for which a text, usually a significant literary or historical text, is paramount.\n",

    "description": "Digital Humanities 2009—the annual joint meeting of the Association for Computers and the Humanities, the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing, and the Society for Digital Humanities / Société pour l’étude des médias interactifs—was hosted by the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland in College Park.\nCoinciding with MITH’s 10th anniversary as a working digital humanities center, we were thrilled to have welcomed this distinguished international community to a campus that has fostered numerous early adopter projects in the field and which continues to innovate with new work on tools, text analysis, electronic editing, virtual worlds, digital preservation, and cyberinfrastructure. As a setting for digital humanities research, MITH also enjoys unusually close relationships with the campus’s iSchool or Information School, the Human-Computer Interaction Lab (the oldest of its kind), and the University Libraries, all of whom were co-sponsors of the conference.\nThe University of Maryland as a conference site put attendees within arm’s length of the capital of the United States and all its cultural institutions (including the Smithsonian, the Library of Congress, the Folger Shakespeare Library, and the Kennedy Center), countless dining options and cuisines from around the globe, and the nearby waterfronts of the Chesapeake Bay, Annapolis, and the city of Baltimore.\nExcursions and activities took full advantage of the wealth of opportunity the area provides, with special tours of the Smithsonian’s vaults or the National Archives, time on the National Mall, and a trip to the Air and Space museum’s recently opened Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles International Airport (whose exhibits include the Space Shuttle Enterprise).\n",

Using the multimedia capabilities of the modern web browser, we created a better framework for studying these important works of drama.\nThe initial phase of the project was funded by a Scholarly Editions Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). In the first year of the project we constructed the web interface and completed work on our first title, the 2008 musical _Glory Days_. In Spring 2011, we received a grant from the Access to Artistic Excellence program of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to continue the work begun under the NEH-Startup grant. Each month the project team is posting a libretto of an important early American musical in a variety of formats and supplementing it with associated photographs, vocal scores, and the occasional audio file.\nThe _Glory Days_ material is used with the kind permission of James Gardiner and Nick Blaemire.\n",

Schuylkill has hosted graduate conferences with no registration fee, hence providing many graduate students with their first experiences as presenters and/or panel chairs.\n",

    "description": "Open Annotation Collaboration (OAC) was a project funded by the Mellon Foundation in three distinct phases between 2009 and 2013. It was primarily led by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, with several other partnerships including MITH, University of Queensland, Los Alamos National Laboratory Research Library, and the Office of Advanced Technology Research at JSTOR. Details on what was accomplished in each phase are available on the project website:\n\n-   [Phase I (July 2009 -- December 2010)](http://www.openannotation.org/phaseI.html)\n-   [Phase II (January 2011 -- February 2013)](http://www.openannotation.org/phaseII.html)\n-   [Phase III (January 2013 -- September 2013)](http://www.openannotation.org/phaseIII.html)\n\nAnnotating is a pervasive element of scholarly practice for both the humanist and the scientist. It is a method by which scholars organize existing knowledge and facilitate the creation and sharing of new knowledge. It is used by individual scholars when reading as an aid to memory, to add commentary, and to classify. It can facilitate shared editing, scholarly collaboration, and pedagogy. Over time annotations can have scholarly value in their own right. Yet scholars remain dissatisfied with the options available for annotating digital resources. Scholars wanting to annotate have to learn different annotation clients for different content repositories, have no easy way to integrate annotations made on different systems or created by colleagues using other tools, and are often limited to simplistic and constrained models of annotation. The importance of annotating as a scholarly practice coupled with the real-world limitations of existing practices and tools supporting annotation of digital content has had a retarding effect on the growth of digital scholarship and the level of digital resource use by scholars.\n\nThe overarching goals of this project (consisting of multiple phases) are:\n\nTo facilitate the emergence of a Web and Resource-centric interoperable annotation environment that allows leveraging annotations across the boundaries of annotation clients, annotation servers, and content collections. To this end, interoperability specifications will be devised.\n\nTo demonstrate through implementations an interoperable annotation environment enabled by the interoperability specifications in settings characterized by a variety of annotation client/server environments, content collections, and scholarly use cases.\n\nTo seed widespread adoption by deploying robust, production-quality applications conformant with the interoperable annotation environment in ubiquitous and specialized services, tools, and content used by scholars --- e.g.: Zotero, AXE, LORE, Co-Annotea, Pliny; JSTOR, AustLit, MONK.\n",

    "description": "This site was constructed with the goal of incorporating Japanese women into the history of the Occupation period, 1945-1952, immediately following Japan's defeat in World War II. It looks at a broad range of activities and draws upon a wide variety of sources. In embracing gender as a vital but neglected means of approach, it also encompasses class and race. Oku Mumeo, whose figure appears on the home page, was a prominent political and social activist from the 1920s to 1945 and won a seat in the Upper House in the first election under the new Constitution of 1947. She also helped to create and lead the Housewives League of 1948 and is sometimes considered to be the founder of Japan's postwar consumer movement. Her name, her achievements, and her philosophy of kitchen politics appear nowhere in early or recent standard histories, although Oku has been rediscovered in women's histories. Yet, even with the advent of women's history in Japan and the rise of feminist consciousness, Japanese women's magazines, newsletters, networks, and creativity in art, drama, and literature, not to mention resilience in daily survival, remain a huge source for study, discourse, and revelation. Another goal in making this site is to encourage research in gender topics and enhance undergraduate studies on Japan across all disciplines from the humanities to the social sciences and sciences.\n\n_Due to rights restrictions, the content for this project can no longer be made publicly available.

    "description": "2018 marks the 200th anniversary of the publication of Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_, a seminal literary work that, since its appearance, has influenced millions of people across the globe. _Frankenstein_ is a rare work of fiction in that it appeals to both novice and expert readers alike, readers who represent both the breadth of human diversity and a range of disciplinary interests and backgrounds. It is a work that remains relevant to contemporary cultural debates concerning issues ranging from biomedical technologies and the ethical questions they raise to misperceptions and misrepresentations of the Other and their impact on our shared humanity. _Frankenstein_ sparks imagination and critical thinking about the human experience, and thus it is perhaps no surprise that it is the most widely taught literary text in the country and the fifth most widely taught book from any discipline.\nTo commemorate the bicentennial of the novel and also to harness its power to generate and inspire communities of readers, the [Keats-Shelley Association of America](http://k-saa.org/) in partnership with the [National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/) is launching \"Frankenreads\": a \"Bloomsday\"-style, national/international public reading of _Frankenstein_ on October 31, 2018. We hope to:\n- engage an international community, including but not limited to North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific in related activities centering on the novel;\n- to make this community visible globally as a community through shared branding and social media;\n- to livestream a public reading of _Frankenstein_ to be held at NEH headquarters for those around the world who are unable to attend one in person;\n- to facilitate bringing regional experts of the novel to such events as lectures, discussions, and film showings held at local libraries and community centers;\n- to hold in the days leading up to [Frankenreads](http://frankenreads.org) an international \"Week of _Frankenstein_,\" during which students, teachers, and the public could hold _Frankenstein_ related events and contribute their thoughts, images, and short videos about _Frankenstein_ to a collective blog.\nWe invite you to discover already planned events near you, or to join our growing list of partners by proposing your own!\n",

The Shakespeare Quartos Archive has been established as the result of joint support from the US National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and the UK Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC).

    "description": "Within Project Bamboo, The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) led Corpora Space, which allows scholars to work at the cutting edge of digital humanities and textual analysis research. In Corpora Space, scholars can discover, analyze and curate digital texts across the 450 years of print culture in English from 1473 until 1923, along with the texts from the Classical world upon which that print culture is based. The initial focus was on the following collections: AUSTLit; Nineteenth-century Scholarship Online (NINES); Google Books; HathiTrust; Oxford Text Archive; Perseus Digital Library; and Text Creation Partnership of Early English Books Online (EEBO) and Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO).\nAs part of the design phase, Corpora Space held a series of workshops. The first meeting between Bamboo and Google gave Corpora Space partners insight into Google’s design principles and process. The second workshop brought together software developers and scholars for a three-day CorporaCamp at MITH. Over the course of the three days, participants successfully built the Woodchipper, a prototype application for exploring distributed, large-scale collections through visualizations supported by techniques from data mining and natural language processing. The Woodchipper was tested across large subsets—up to several hundred million words — of the HathiTrust Digital Library, EEBO-TCP and ECCO-TCP, and the Perseus Digital Library. It allows users to build collections of texts from across these sources and to explore these collections by mapping them in a two-dimensional thematic space.\nMITH held ToolMixer, the third workshop in the Corpora Space Design process, on June 6-7, 2011. Tool builders, scholars, and members of Project Bamboo met to work on key issues related to connecting tools and architecture to digital collections. Project Bamboo partners were joined by representatives of the Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia, NINES and 18thConnect, HathiTrust Research Center, SEASR, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and University of California Riverside to hear presentations from tool builders and plan how tools would connect to the Corpora Space infrastructure. Additionally, we conducted break-out sessions to discuss how the various tools would link together in a scholarly workflow. This workshop brought us significantly closer to finalizing decisions about the core set of tools to be included in the initial implementation phase of Corpora Space, slated for Spring 2012.\n",

    "description": "Documenting the Now (DocNow) responds to the public's use of social media for chronicling historically significant events as well as demand from scholars and archivists seeking a user-friendly means of collecting and preserving digital content. This two-year project was funded by a $517,000 grant from [The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/), and MITH will work with Washington University in St. Louis and the University of California, Riverside, as collaborators on the project. The three institutions are developing DocNow, a cloud-ready, open-source application that will be used for collecting tweets and their associated metadata and Web content.\nThe dramatic rise in the public's use of social media services to document events of historical significance presents archivists and others who build primary source research collections with a unique opportunity to transform appraisal, collecting, preservation and discovery of this new type of research data. The personal nature of documenting participation in historical events also presents researchers with new opportunities to engage with the data generated by individual users of services such as Twitter, which has emerged as one of the most important tools used in social activism to build support, share information and remain engaged. Twitter users document activities or events through the text, images, videos and audio embedded in or linked from their tweets. This means vast amounts of digital content is being shared and re-shared using Twitter as a platform for other social media applications like YouTube, Instagram, Flickr and the Web at large. While such digital content adds a new layer of documentary evidence that is immensely valuable to those interested in researching and understanding contemporary events, it also presents significant data management, rights management, access and visualization challenges.\nDocNow will develop new tools, knowledge and user communities to enable and promote the collection, preservation, visualization and analysis of social media content generated through this new wave of social activism, storytelling and community documentation. The project will result in an open-source application for collecting tweets, their associated Web content (text, images, video and audio) and metadata, as well as creating data views and export mechanisms both for use with data visualization platforms and for preservation. It will utilize Ferguson-related tweets and Web content as the subject of application development, delivering a Ferguson social media data set for research and preservation, and build a community of users and advocates around the DocNow application.\n",

Using existing oral histories, testimonies, photographs, video footage, material objects, and sound recordings in the collections of the Hector Pieterson Memorial & Museum, the work seeks to redress the existing portrayal of the lives of township residents in the mainstream or \"official\" historical record. Soweto '76 seeks to first address the absence of accounts from those students involved in the Uprisings (1) by making these multimedia texts accessible online and (2) by providing digital tools to facilitate a comparative analysis of the competing interpretations of key events. The site undertakes the challenges of collating the experiences (or \"collating the narratives\") and interpretations of the various historical and contemporary actors. The vantage point of the user changes as the various forms of multimedia data are accessed on the site. These \"collated narratives\" include both spatial and temporal representations of the events occurring on 16 June 1976.\n\nOn that fateful day in 1976, Soweto students gathered to protest the use of the Afrikaans language as a medium of teaching and learning in black schools. Shortly thereafter, police began shooting at the assembled marchers, violently disrupting what was to be a peaceful protest. Hector Pieterson's death---and the subsequent murder of other protestors in the Uprisings that would help bring about the first democratic elections of 1994---are memorialized at this national heritage site.\n",

The ICLC comprised one website which initially supported four web-based distance courses: Diversity in American Cultures, Cross-Cultural Communication, and two courses in English for speakers of other languages from the Maryland English Institute. The four courses were also planned to be linked for some activities in a multiple-course environment. The site contained many pedagogical features including chat, threaded conferences, space for individual and collaborative projects, readings and other resources.\n",

    "description": "In 1985 Samuel Beckett directed \"Waiting for Godot\", \"Krapp's Last Tape\" and \"Endgame\" as stage pieces with the San Quentin Players. All three productions were grouped together under the overall title \"Beckett Directs Beckett.\" As such they toured throughout Europe and in some parts of Asia to wide acclaim. Furthermore, each time a new tour was organized for these productions, after sometimes lengthy lacunae, Beckett has, with the assistance of Walter Asmus, and/or Alan Mandell, brought them back to performance level.\n\nThough the initial productions as staged in 1985 already brought forth substantial changes in the published acting texts of the plays, each time a re-mounting of the productions occurred additional changes were made. The same was true during the production period for these television versions, with Beckett sometimes making textual changes on the telephone even as a given scene was being taped. For these productions, it was our intention and design to open them out beyond the confines of the stage in order to accommodate them to the television medium. Walter Asmus and Alan Mandell, both of whom enjoyed the author's complete confidence, were responsible for this part of the endeavor.\n",

    "description": "The Digital Humanities Data Curation Institutes project will facilitate a multi-institutional collaboration between MITH and the University Libraries at UMD, the [Women Writers Project ](http://www.wwp.brown.edu/)(WWP) at Brown University, and the [Center for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship ](http://cirss.lis.illinois.edu/)(CIRSS) at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS), at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign to provide three workshops during 2013.\nThe practice of cutting-edge humanities research increasingly involves acquisition, synthesis, and management of data in digital form. The theoretical knowledge and practical skills of information science, librarianship, and archival science represent a vital component of the skill set that will be required to succeed in the rapidly transforming landscape of the academy and the wider society.\nDigital Humanities Data Curation institutes served as opportunities for participants with all levels of expertise—from beginners to the most advanced—to receive guidance in understanding the role of data curation in enriching humanities research projects. By the conclusion of each institute, participants will be adept at formulating solutions for existing challenges and will be able to document their data curation strategies in the form of data curation plans and strategic risk assessments, a key element of innovative digital scholarship.\nApplications to join this cohort of scholars focused on discipline-specific curation practices and skills were announced in late fall 2012, with the Institute beginning in Spring 2013. The Digital Humanities Data Curation Institutes project is supported by a National Endowment for the Humanities Institutes for Advanced Topics grant (2012).\nA generous grant from the [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://www.neh.gov/) will support a series of three-day workshops to introduce humanists, librarians, and advanced graduate students to the principles and practices of data curation.\n## About the Institute\nCarrying out computational research with digital materials requires that both scholars and information professionals understand how to manage and curate data over its entire lifetime of interest. At the least, individual scholars must be able to document their data curation strategies and evaluate those of collaborators and other purveyors of humanities data. The three-day workshops will provide a strong introductory grounding in data curation concepts and practices, focusing on the special issues and challenges of data curation in the digital humanities. Learning will be largely case-based, supplemented by short lectures, guest presentations, and practical exercises.\nAll participants will also have access to an online resource for sharing knowledge about data curation for the humanities. This resource will build on material from the existing [DH Curation Guide](http://guide.dhcuration.org/).\nParticipants will learn how to:\n- Model humanities data for sustainable computational research\n- Identify, assess, and mitigate risks to their data\n- Evaluate tools and systems for working with data from a curatorial perspective\n- Plan and implement data management during all phases of a project’s lifecycle\n- Leverage data curation skills to improve scholarly publications, grant applications, and promotion dossiers\n- Understand and stay current with the landscape of data curation research\n",

Addressing the role of digital media in the transnational flow of feminist ideas, politics, and protesters, the project focused on Germany in order to examine the way transnational feminist activism intersects with the national configuration of feminist political work, and how feminist activism may in turn transform emergent digital cultures. Bringing together scholars from the US, Canada, Germany, and the UK, this transdisciplinary, collaborative project engaged digital media not only as its scholarly focus but also as a key component of the project's methodology. Combining digital humanities paradigms with a conventional academic publishing project, _Digital Feminisms_ sought to develop a new research model that reaches multiple constituencies, while also reflecting critically on the subject of transnational feminist activism and digital culture through its presentation formats.\n",

          "Stephanie develops, coordinates and implements digital research projects which foster collaborations between MITH and other library, archival, or cultural heritage organizations. This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of iotaCenter, a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions."

          "Mirona Magearu is a PhD Candidate in Comparative Literature at University of Maryland, College Park. She received her bachelor’s degree from The University of Bucharest, Romania, a Master’s degree in communication from The National School of Political Studies, Bucharest, and another Master’s degree in English from Emporia State University, Kansas. During her graduate studies she became fascinated with the power of computerized typography and explored the relationship between digital studies and rhetoric. Funded by a MITH dissertation fellowship in Spring 2010 she conducted archival research on video poetry at La Casa Totiana, Rome, and at The University of Pisa. She is currently working on her dissertation project, a comparative analysis which engages works produced by Loss Pequeno Glazier (a United States digital poet of Tejano origins) and Caterina Davinio, an Italian computer pioneer. This comparative study extends work on performance developed by theater and poetry theorists and uses its findings to investigate whether the performance of digital poetry opens up space for new and potentially more inclusive conceptions of identity."

    "description": "Choreographer Merce Cunningham’s death in the summer of 2009 was a stark reminder of the ephemerality of dance and of the rapidly vanishing human record of the art in the 20th century. Although a good deal of work has been done using notation systems, video, motion capture technologies, and oral history, there is still a strong feeling among dancers, software developers, and scholars that current methods do not sufficiently document the art and allow it to be preserved over time. Dance scholars, artists, and motion capture specialists have long understood that dance consists of much more than the motion of the body through space, though what else and to what degree other elements are important is a matter of much debate.\nThe Documentation and Preservation of Dance project brings together an interdisciplinary team from MITH, the Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design (ACCAD) at Ohio State University, the John F.

The resulting documentary video and its study guide explored how new technologies such as the Internet, satellite communications, email, videoconferences, and cell phones have changed the experience of displacement.\nWith a comparative and translocal approach, this project explores multiple relationships with new technologies determined by gender, age, race, ethnicity, education, computer literacy, geographical situation, and socio-economic background. Through their differing and even contradictory discourses and practices, expressed and lived in geographical locations that coexist and overlap on the screen, the protagonists of this dissertation-documentary video show us to what extent they are inscribed in different places of enunciation that shape their experience of displacement and nostalgia in contrasting ways.\n_[Text extracted from dissertation abstract, located in the Digital Repository at the University of Maryland (DRUM).](http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/6891)_\n",

    "description": "Books.Files: Assessing Digital Assets in the Book Industry for Scholarly Use is a project to assess the potential for the archival collection and scholarly study of digital assets associated with today's trade publishing and bookmaking. Books.Files was generously funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, as a collaboration between MITH and the [Book Industry Study Group.](http://bisg.org/)\nThe fact is that nearly all printed books now begin---and for many practical purposes end---their lifecycles as digital files that are produced and managed by designers, editors, publishers, packagers, and printers. The printed book that we hold in our hands is just one of the outputs that can be derived from these digital assets, which are also used to produce ebooks and Web-ready texts. In particular, the role of Adobe InDesign and other software tools is not well understood outside of the industry. And yet, this is where the book stops being a manuscript and starts _becoming_ a book, by way of its transformation into a prescribed set of digital assets which in addition to the text may include stylesheets, fonts, metadata, images, and other design elements.\nLed by principal investigator Matthew Kirschenbaum, this project represents the first organized attempt to put ambassadors from the scholarly communities traditionally invested in safeguarding and studying the material history of bookmaking into contact and conversation with thought leaders and influencers from the contemporary publishing world. The centerpiece of the project will be a convening to bring those figures together in New York City in early 2018; Kirschenbaum's efforts will also be supported by site visits to observe the bookmaking process as it unfolds across different settings, and interviews with industry experts. Findings for scholars, archivists, and publishers will be presented in a white paper made publicly available in late 2018.\nInquiries about Books.Files may be sent to [Matthew Kirschenbaum](mailto:mgk@umd.edu).\n",

          "Stephanie develops, coordinates and implements digital research projects which foster collaborations between MITH and other library, archival, or cultural heritage organizations. This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of iotaCenter, a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions."

In addition to the fact that online courses were gaining significant traction at universities during this time, an additional rationale was that, (from the project proposal), \"Issues of cultural pluralism, accelerated immigration patterns, and the globalization of knowledge have created a climate wherein scholars and performers with training in ethnomusicology are beginning to play a critical role. The demographic changes affecting the US are also being felt in Spain and Latin America, where there are virtually no universities offering degrees or even basic training in ethnomusicology. Meanwhile, Spanish schools and music institutes are clamoring for help in integrating a growing gypsy and North African population, and Latin American educators are struggling with ways in which the voices of indigenous peoples can be made audible. The interdisciplinary, cross-cultural training of ethnomusicologists prepares them to build bridges and create dialogue between human populations through performance.\"\n\nFormer MITH Faculty Fellow Carolina Robertson, who eventually worked on the [Narratives That Heal](../../index.html%3Fp=6417.html) project, collaborated with MITH on the development of the online learning environment for this Distributed Learning Masters, making Spain/Online an early \"MITH Affiliate.\" You can view an [archived version of the website](https://web.archive.org/web/20030624011209/http://www.e-learning.umd.edu/ethno/programdescription.html) on the Wayback Machine.\n",

    "description": "In a “culture of images” where access to and transmission of integrated text, video, photographs, and sound happens almost seamlessly, the poetic tradition of looking at, describing, and narrating the visual arts—ekphrasis—might appear quaint. Why would poets spend so much time writing about these subjects when cameras, computers, copiers, screens, and printers have made reproduction almost effortless? And yet, in the face of these emerging technologies and the rapid reproduction of art by an increasingly technologically savvy public, some of the most celebrated poems of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries are ekphrastic.\nThis study considers the unlikely popularity of contemporary ekphrastic poems, particularly those by female poets in the U.S., and theorizes a broader, more complex model to explain how the genre operates, one which accounts for inter-aesthetic relationships historically labeled as outliers. Using advanced computational methods, this project challenges longstanding critical assumptions about ekphrasis: that poets will ultimately comment on the stillness and muteness of the visual work of art; that ekphrastic speech turns upon the typically gendered axis of inter-arts rivalry; that descriptions of art and descriptions of nature in verse are indistinguishable in style and form. By supporting the use of computational tools to read patterns of subjects and word choice across hundreds of modern poems, the MITH Winnemore Dissertation Fellowship enables this project to uncover new methodologies for asking traditional humanities questions—ones stretching back as far as Homer’s description of Achilles’ shield in _The Illiad_—from new perspectives and with fresh insight.\nThe Winnemore phase of Review, Revise, Requery was completed August 2012.\n_The technological infrastructure for this project has been supported in part by a generous grant from [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/)._\n",

It developed from a meeting hosted by the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities and the University of Maryland, College Park, April 12-13, 2007 in Washington, D.C., and is a response to the American Council of Learned Societies report on Cyberinfrastructure for the Humanities and Social Sciences, published in 2006. Since its inception in April 2007, centerNet has added over 200 members from about 100 centers in 19 countries. Regional centerNet affiliates have been established in Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, and the U.K. and Ireland, each with a steering committee. In 2009, centerNet became a founding member with DARIAH, CLARIN, PROJECT BAMBOO, and ADHO of CHAIN: the Coalition of Humanities and Arts Infrastructures and Networks. In June 2010, centerNet formally affiliated with the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes (CHCI) in order to pursue an ambitious agenda of initiatives on matters of mutual interest. Together, the two organizations hope to foster disciplinary innovation and transformation in the humanities.\n",

    "description": "The Digital Humanities Incubator is intended to help introduce University of Maryland faculty, staff, and graduate assistants to digital humanities methods and tools through a series of workshops, tutorials, and project consultations. The [first phase of the Incubator](../digital-humanities-incubator-2012-13/index.html) concentrated on working with UMD Libraries faculty and staff exclusively. This second phase, entitled \"Researching Ferguson,\" is a broader campus-wide initiative which aims to provide leadership and training on event-based social media data and network analysis.\nIn October 2014, MITH began spearheading a series of meetings to develop research and teaching opportunities for the use of the [Ferguson Twitter archive](../../miths-ed-summers-discusses-ferguson-twitter-archive/index.html), which is a collection of tweets harvested by MITH's Ed Summers using a command line program named [twarc](http://github.com/edsu/twarc) in August 2014 in the wake of the events in Ferguson, MO. MITH's early work with this collection was conducted in collaboration with the ARHU Center for Synergy, and in October and December 2014 MITH hosted two brainstorming sessions with various UMD faculty and students. MITH introduced the collection and solicited feedback regarding its possible value and use to the scholarly community.\nThe discussions that took place at both prior events allowed MITH to synthesize the input that was received, which was used to begin planning for several ongoing MITH [Digital Humanities Incubator](../digital-humanities-incubator/index.html) sessions ran throughout February 2015 as part of Black History Month, and continued throughout Spring 2015. These workshops were part of the broader, university-wide effort to engage the [#BlackLivesMatter](http://blacklivesmatterumd.tumblr.com/) movement at the University of Maryland.\n",

          "Stephanie develops, coordinates and implements digital research projects which foster collaborations between MITH and other library, archival, or cultural heritage organizations. This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of iotaCenter, a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions."

The two-year $590,000 award under NDIIPP's Preserving Creative America program was shared among the project participants.\n\nThe Preserving Virtual Worlds project explored methods for preserving digital games, interactive fiction, and shared real time virtual spaces. Major activities include developing basic standards for metadata and content representation and conducting a series of archiving case studies for early video games and electronic literature, as well as Second Life, the popular and influential multi-user online world.\n\nAccording to Fraistat, \"This award from the Library of Congress places MITH and its partners at the forefront of those addressing a range of increasingly urgent questions involving the preservation of creative works that are \"born digital\"---from interactive electronic literature, to digital games, to virtual worlds such as Second Life. We are especially pleased to have as an industry partner, Linden Lab, the creator of Second Life itself.\"\n\nIn addition to contributing to the work on Second Life, MITH took the lead on interactive fiction/electronic literature as a sub-domain of the project, and is occupied with all aspects of scoping, metadata, intellectual property, evaluation, and archiving of these materials. MITH initially focused on a small number of targeted works of recognized cultural and literary significance, including former Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky's 1984 interactive novel _Mindwheel_, Will Crowther's ADVENTURE (written in 1975 and widely considered the earliest interactive text of its kind), and selected items from a large private collection of 1980s-era hardware and software recently gifted to MITH.\n",

Political events such as the [Arab Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring) and social movements like [Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter) show what important work is possible with social media at scale.\nAt the same time social media can be used to spread messages of intolerance, harassment and hate, as we've seen in the rhetoric surrounding [Gamergate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy) and the [2016 presidential race](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2016/hate-race). Women, members of ethnic minorities, and activists often find themselves the target of trolls and organized groups that attempt to shut down and silence their work.\nPlease join us at MITH (and remotely) to gather with others looking to learn from each other about how to investigate and thwart hate speech in social media. The Southern Poverty Law Center's [Extremist Files](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files) provides a list of known hate groups. At our Night Against Hate event we will collaboratively try to link the SPLC list to social media accounts. This list can then be used by researchers here at UMD and elsewhere to examine the effect that these groups are having online. In addition, we hope to use this event to learn from each other about emerging tools and techniques of self care while working online.\nIf you're planning to attend in person or remotely, [please click here to sign up.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_eIHiYZiDqwmxLebU1VDwh5U381cTLFP0jOJd7ijJ0ufLrw/viewform) Pizza will be provided for those that can make it to MITH.\n",

          "Stephanie develops, coordinates and implements digital research projects which foster collaborations between MITH and other library, archival, or cultural heritage organizations. This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of iotaCenter, a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions."

    "description": "The Ajax XML Encoder (AXE), developed at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), revolutionizes the production of electronic editions and digital archives. AXE, the first item in MITH's proposed toolkit for the digital humanities, is a web-based tool for \"tagging\" text, video, audio, and image files with XML metadata, a process that is now a necessary but onerous first step in the production of digital material. With an intuitive, web-based interface, AXE makes this process more efficient and accurate. It also facilitates collaboration in the digital humanities by permitting multiple scholars to work on the same document or archive at the same time from various locations, and tracks all work so that variant versions can be collated and all versions can be archived. The open source AXE provides a free and improved alternative to existing software for tagging all kinds of digital content in an increasingly web-based and multi-medial digital environment.\n",

    "description": "Digital music scores have the potential of being flexible, interactive, and dynamic. Raff Viglianti has created two dynamic scores influenced by the weather as a proof-of-concept.\n_[Meteomozart](https://raffazizzi.github.io/meteomozart/)_ is a dynamic score of Mozart's Piano Sonata No.13 in B♭ major, K.333/315c. The score is dynamically adjusted based on the weather at your location (or at a location you set). Different slurs and dynamics are shown, taken from four sources: Mozart's 1783 manuscript, the first printed edition (1784) and two performing editions by Bartók (1911) and Saint-Saëns (1915). Meteomozart presents a slightly unpredictable text instead of a clear one. It is obvious from audio recordings that the same work of music can be performed in more than one way; likewise, this experiment tries to make it obvious that the score may have more than just one \"text\" and possibly pique the interest of performers to take control of the variants as opposed to having the weather determining them.\n_[Chance of Weather](https://raffazizzi.github.io/chanceOfWeather/)_ is a dynamic piano piece by composer Joseph L. Arkfeld (UMD). _Chance of Weather_ is a modern take on a piano program piece that takes inspiration from weather conditions. Rather than focusing on a specific condition or setting, such as Debussy's _Jardins sous la pluie_, _Chance of Weather_ engages with the weather that is currently affecting the performance environment. The piece is based on a dynamic digital score that follows pre-composed patterns depending on the weather at the location where it is being performed. The piece invites the outside world into the performance space, which is usually sterile to the elements. If the audience had to walk through a windy and rainy evening to get to a windowless, temperature controlled performance space, they will find that _Chance of Weather_ evokes the gusts and the dampness of their day. Likewise, if they came on a pleasant warm afternoon, the piece will reflect their recent experience.\n",

In total, these partner libraries contain over 90% of all known relevant manuscripts.\nAs we expand the holdings of the S-GA, we are providing open and centralized access for the widely distributed manuscripts, making them viewable as pages both in the order in which they appear in the manuscript and in the linear sequence in which they appear in the work. Over time, we hope to present all known manuscripts for any given work of our four authors.\nThe innovative technical architecture of the S-GA builds on open standards and the principles of the linked data movement, and has been designed to support user curation in subsequent phases of the project. Rather than serving only as a point of access, the S-GA will thus function ultimately as a work-site for scholars, students, and the general public, whose contributions in the form of transcriptions, corrections, annotations, and TEI encoding will create a commons through which various discourse networks related to its texts intersect and interact. The more immediate goal for the S-GA’s current phase, however, is to provide access to page images under open licenses with fully encoded transcriptions for as many of these manuscripts as possible.\n For more information on the project and for a full list of participants and sponsors [visit the project website](http://www.shelleygodwinarchive.org).\n",

          "Stephanie develops, coordinates and implements digital research projects which foster collaborations between MITH and other library, archival, or cultural heritage organizations. This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of iotaCenter, a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions."

    "description": "The Portinari Project was one of the initial MITH Networked Associate Fellowship projects. MITH worked with João Candido Portinari, son of the late painter Candido Portinari, on a digital resource to make his work and legacy available broadly on the web.\n\nThe late Candido Portinari is considered to be the greatest artist Brazil has ever produced, yet by the year 2000, all but a few of his 4,000 paintings were out of public view. They had become dispersed in private collections in so many places that his biographer compared their fate to that of Brazil's 18th-century revolutionary hero Tiradentes, whose body was dismembered and strewn along a 300-mile turnpike. The inaccessibility of Portinari's work was particularly vexing to his enthusiasts because his own dedication to producing an epic view of Brazil for his countrymen was such that he continued painting even after doctors warned him that exposure to paint was killing him. He died of lead poisoning in 1962 at the age of 59. In a pioneering effort for Latin America in 2000, a team of experts in Rio began assembling the far-flung pieces of Portinari's oeuvre into an exhaustive digital archive, where images as well as descriptive texts would eventually be fully searchable.\n\nJoão Candido Portinari, the painter's son, coordinated the group of researchers who made their headquarters on the leafy campus of Rio's Pontifical Catholic University. A telecommunications engineer with a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former chairman of the university's mathematics department, Mr. Portinari brought exacting technical standards to the task. The 14-member team compiled photographic, technical, historical and bibliographical records on 3,800 of the paintings.\n\nPortinari's personal habits and the scant attention that Brazilian society has traditionally paid to preserving its heritage have added a dash of challenge to the team's work. Portinari himself often didn't sign of date his paintings, he gave many of them away, and he failed to keep records on some of those that he sold. Art dealing was long a haphazard affair in Brazil; the first commercial gallery in Rio de Janeiro opened only in 1960. Researchers have worked from some of the 8,000 pieces of correspondence and scores of photographs they have gathered to ferret out dates, titles, and sometimes the existence of previously unknown Portinari paintings.\n\nDuring its development, the project benefited from Brazilian Government grants, appeals abroad by Brazilian diplomatic missions, a contribution of free film and photographic equipment from Eastman Kodak, donations and the use of a computer from the International Business Machines Corporation, free tickets on the Brazilian international airline Varig and 30-second calls over the country's major television network, TV Globo, that João Candido estimated had reached 30-million Brazilians. The search for Portinari's paintings took the research team to 13 Brazilian states and to countries as wide ranging as Argentina, Finland, Haiti, and Bulgaria. The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) was proud to host and help develop the early version of an online catalog and image display of Portinari's work.\n",

The blog was described as \"the online hub for news and discussion relating to the academic study of musical theatre. Although the serious study of musical theatre is rapidly gaining interest in both the United States and the United Kingdom, the scholarly community, as yet, lacks an efficient online means of communication. It is the aim of this blog to meet this need. We will soon be posting calls for papers, academic job opportunities, book reviews, and other news items of interest to the musical theatre scholarly community.\"\n\nThe blog was maintained sporadically until 2009, and MITH now maintains it as a legacy website.\n",

It was researched and designed by Walker Sampson, who recently completed an MLS from the School of Information at the University of Texas. Sampson was in residence at MITH during the summer of 2010 under the auspices of the IMLS-sponsored Digital Humanities Model Internship Program. MITH's Associate Director Matthew Kirschenbaum comments, \"This site demonstrates the role that vintage computing can have in the environment of an active digital humanities center; as born-digital cultural heritage becomes ever more important, centers such as MITH will play a part alongside of libraries and archives in addressing its long-term presentation and curation.\"\n",

Lakeland thrived until its self-contained uniqueness was undermined by social change and a devastating urban renewal program which used eminent domain to \"take\" two thirds of Lakeland's territory and relocate roughly sixty-five households elsewhere in Prince George's County. Promised improved housing for Lakelanders never materialized, and the housing eventually built was not made available to displaced residents.\nIn 2009 the Department of American Studies began a collaboration with the Lakeland Community Heritage Project, establishing an ongoing community-engaged project whose primary achievement is creation of [The Lakeland Digital Archive](http://lakeland.umd.edu/). The partnership provides LCHP -- an all-volunteer historical society -- with student and faculty labor to help document and archive Lakeland's history, while training students in an ethical and equitable practice of collaborative heritage research wherein Lakelanders produce historical knowledge using their own voices. The Archive contains photographs, land records, census data, newspaper clippings, maps, dozens of oral history sound files, archival records, and video recordings.\nMITH is directing a multiple-year effort to redesign the archive website in collaboration with members of the Lakeland community, and to explore other platforms for making Lakeland's heritage accessible to different populations: current and former Lakelanders, community elders, community young people, residents of Prince George's County, MD, and scholars interested in the history of African American communities and urban renewal and its ongoing consequences.\n",

    "description": "The Our Americas Archive Partnership is a collaboration between MITH's [Early Americas Digital Archive](../../index.html%3Fp=5109.html) and Rice University's [Americas Archive](http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/9219), Rice's [Humanities Research Center](http://hrc.rice.edu/), Rice's [Fondren Library](http://library.rice.edu/) and the library at [Instituto Mora](http://www.institutomora.edu.mx/) in Mexico. Its goal is to make digitally available texts written in or about the Americas that represent the full range and complexity of a multilingual \"Americas\" including Canada, the Caribbean, and Latin America.\n\nThe partnership between Maryland's Early Americas Digital Archive (1492-1820) and Rice's Americas collection (1811-1920) creates unique new research and teaching opportunities. The point of convergence between the Maryland and Rice archives is the cultural transformation created by the revolutions for independence that took place over a span of fewer than sixty years. The archive, however, spans the five hundred year period that saw the making of modern and colonial cultures in the Americas. Because of its range, the archive promises to reinvigorate the study of American literary and cultural history by creating surprising juxtapositions, emphasizing different models of periodization, and suggesting new avenues of cross-cultural influence.\n\nThe archive fosters new research that examines American literatures from a hemispheric perspective, develops a collection of texts, curricular models and teaching materials that embody a hemispheric approach to the study of the early Americas, and generates professional and intellectual exchanges among scholars from various fields.\n\n_The list of participating people on this page is only a partial list---the full set of acknowledgements for the project can be found [on the project website](http://oaap.rice.edu/about.php?page=project)._\n",

A significant component of such work has been the study of theatre architecture. The Theatre Architecture working group of the International Federation for Theatre Research has begun to examine the ways in which architecture can establish audience expectations, and enhance or limit an audience's experience of a performance.\nLittle attempt has been made, however, to apply these approaches to historic theatre buildings, in large part because of the prohibitive costs of locating and traveling to structures scattered around the world. Theatre Finder is an attempt create the necessary finding aid for these buildings and provide a consistent body of relevant data for them, with digital reconstructions at a consistent scale.\n",

    "description": "This was a project of Spring 2011 MITH Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow Maria Velazquez. Her dissertation, “Electronic Skin: Community Building and Virtual Embodiment” investigated the creative processes through which citizens are made, with particular attention to the role that technologies like blogging, virtual reality, and electronic activism foster the use of “imaginative embodiment” in creating stories of citizenship, selfhood, and action. “Imaginative embodiment” suggests the ways in which performing citizenship involves a mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual investment in incarnating particular political and social ideals. Velazquez’s examineds three areas, the [Go Mamasita! Dance Studio](http://gomamasita.org/), a site envisioned as a place where women of color, particularly African- American women, can reconnect with dance ancestry, a nexus to North African dance traditions, filtered through the lens of digital diaspora; [Red Light Center ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Light_Center)(RLC), an adults-only virtual world, similar in design to World of Warcraft or SecondLife, to discuss the role pre-structuring technology takes in creating erotic virtual cityscapes; and the blogosphere, particularly blogs that grapple with anti-racist discourse, fandom, and popular culture. Through an investigation of these spaces, Velazquez described the ways individuals engage in virtual and “real-world” activism. Actions and behaviors that highlight the ways in which the language of friendship, holism, and community is mobilized in conversations about citizenship, the body, and desire. While a dance studio, a pornographic virtual world, and segments of the blogosphere may seem like a disparate collection of sites for investigation, all three share an abiding interest in the body and its potential as site of pleasure.\n",

    "description": "2016-17 Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow Avery Dame spent his fellowship year building the [Transgender Usenet Archive](http://transusenet.averydame.net/), a public archive of posts from targeted Usenet newsgroups which grew in popularity during the 1990's upswing in online discussion forums, in this case around groups which were central to the development of a transgender community.\nFrom the earliest days of Fidonet, trans individuals have made spaces for discussion and resource-sharing online. Some of these spaces were hosted on Usenet, a decentralized, worldwide discussion system founded in 1980 and organized around topic-specific newsgroups. [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet), as a communications network, is an influential predecessor to modern social media platforms and the origin point for now-common bits of contemporary Internet vocabulary like \"spam.\"\nThese spaces offered transgender users the opportunity to communicate and find support, without falling into \"maladaptive\" coping strategies. The resulting archive is a record of online discussions in five important transgender-related forums:\n1. Alt.transgendered;\n2. Soc.support.transgendered;\n3. Alt.support.srs;\n4. Alt.support.crossdressing; and\n5. alt.fashion.crossdressing.\nDame's research focuses on how posters use the term \"cisgender\" in their discussions. These groups are one of the few archival locations where participants regularly used the term, and several origin narratives point to different newsgroups as being the where it was first used. His larger dissertation explores the affective and structural meanings assigned to \"community\" in English-language transgender discourse online. Read more about Avery's research, methodologies, and the process of building the archive in the [blog posts](../../tag/transgender-usenet-archive/index.html) completed during his fellowship.\n[Users can access the archive here](http://transusenet.averydame.net/), and can search for any single word or two word phrase. Searches can be filtered by newsgroup or post publication year. By default, all searches are case sensitive, but this setting can be changed under the \"Case\" header on the far right corner next to the \"Search\" button. Each search result under \"click for texts\" includes a link to a plain text file of that message, including date and message subject.\n",

    "description": "Katie King began thinking about feminism and writing technologies while working in the early 80s on her dissertation, which was on academic editorial practices and feminist political practices making these interesting literary objects sometimes called \"poems.\" She looked specifically at the literary productions and literary histories of Emily Dickinson and Audre Lorde and the social and institutional practices that shaped their work to look like what folks in their time periods and cohorts of action would call \"poems.\"\n\nEarlier, throughout the 70s, as an undergraduate in California and then as a graduate student at the University of Chicago King had studied ancient Greek and Old English epic poetry, and then the work of Chaucer, with an eye to investigating oral formulaic poetry. The theoretical approach she took in her dissertation later in the 80s was inspired by the work of her teacher, Donna Haraway, and her analyses of feminist primate researchers, although the methods she used were necessarily rather different in examining literary objects and became elements of her talk about feminism and writing technologies. King was particularly helped by Haraway's transformations of the work of Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar's anthropology of the scientific laboratory in their book, Laboratory Life.\n\nKing's [Feminism and Writing Technologies](http://web.archive.org/web/20070609001807/http://www.mith.umd.edu/fellows/king/printshop.html) was an early MITH Faculty Fellow project which featured a virtual 17th-century Quaker women's printshop designed to plumb more fully (by reconfiguring objects of study) the intertwinings of print and digital distributions of knowledge production and their implications for research in the twenty-first century university.\n",

Working in collaboration with the [University of Texas at Austin](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/english/), as well as the [Center for Digital Research in the Humanities](http://cdrh.unl.edu/) at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, the project team is focusing on Walt Whitman’s annotations and commentary about history, science, theology, and art being discussed during his time. These annotations survived in many forms, either as marginalia and underlinings on books, or as collages of newspaper clippings, or as separate handwritten notes. Studying this material can further our understanding of the poet’s self-education and his compositional methods.\nMITH is now building a digital publication around these precisely encoded data. To do so, we are adapting the tools developed for our own [Shelley-Godwin Archive](https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/research/shelley-godwin-archive/index.html). The _Shelley-Godwin Archive_ provides the digitized manuscripts of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, William Godwin, and Mary Wollstonecraft, bringing together online for the first time ever the widely dispersed handwritten legacy of this uniquely gifted family of writers. The archive makes use of Linked Open Data principles and emerging standards such as the [Open Annotation](http://www.openannotation.org/) and the [Shared Canvas](http://www.shared-canvas.org/) data models in order to open the contents of the archive to widespread use and reuse. The Linked Open Data drive our rendering engines and is generated directly from the TEI files. By adapting our Shelley-Godwin tools for Whitman, we found that Open Annotation was particularly suited for modeling Whitman’s own annotations, as the data model offered a basic and open system to represent generic annotation acts (for example by relating a piece of Whitman’s commentary to the specific portion of text that it annotates).\nThe final digital publication will allow users to read semi-diplomatic transcriptions of the texts alongside facsimile images, as well as visually distinguish regions of text annotated by Whitman. We are also building a search system that indexes the text according to several categories, so that users may search on text annotated by Whitman as opposed to text written by the author, etc.\n",

Driskell Center and MITH co-produced the Gwendolyn Brooks Poetry Slam, an event designed to bring high school students, university students, and university faculty together to celebrate African-American literary heritage. Supported by grants from the Hechts Company and the Maryland Humanities Council, and by contributions of staff time from Driskell and MITH, the Slam enjoyed an audience of more than 350 (in fact, not all of the attendees could fit into the Driskell Center's Events Room), and served as the inauguration for the \"Spoken Word\" workshop with high school students offered in summer 2004 by Corey Roberts, a Driskell Center Fellow and doctoral candidate in Theatre at the University of Maryland.\n\nBuilding on the highly successful [Poetry Slam honoring Langston Hughes](../../index.html%3Fp=5290.html) and held in the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center in February 2002 (produced by Driskell & MITH and co-sponsored by Borders), this Slam honored contemporary African-American poet Gwendolyn Brooks. As had the previous Slam, the April 24 event pitted local high school poets selected by competitions within their schools against Terp poets. With fond memories of the February 2002 Langston Hughes Poetry Slam, judges David Driskell and music faculty Carmen Balthrop were joined by filmmaker [Irvin Kershner](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0449984/) for what was an intense battle of words and wits. It was a packed house, as students, their teachers, parents and friends cheered the competitors on. In summer 2004 the poetry slam was followed up with the \"Spoken Word\" workshop for participants and other high school students, intensive sessions designed to foster students' abilities to hone poetry for performance.\n\n### Slam\n\n_Sat, Apr 24, 2004_\n",

    "description": "This was a project of Patricia Cossard, the first UMD Libraries Faculty Fellow, in Spring 2005. The goal was the creation of a Medieval Studies electronic resource in a thesaurus structure, plus a structure for classifying historical persons and locations for a multinational, multilingual public.\n\nThe stated need for this was based on Cossard's argument that previous electronic resources in Medieval Studies had been closed source, using closed systems, local standards, unstable access, and irregular archiving. She argued that this closed environment had not served the medieval studies community well, in that the field had traditionally been based on networking and shared sources. The thesaurus attempted to use best-practice from publishing and library sciences to create an open tool for medievalists and associated professionals, such as librarians.\n\nImagine the ability to search across web-resources using your native modern European language and find appropriate primary and secondary sources in Latin, French, Italian, German, Spanish, English, etc., based upon the meaning rather than the form of the search term. Imagine having a tool that would enable you to search for a concept and be able to construct the forms it has taken historically as well as the ability to link outward for both evidence and argument. Imagine a tool that would enable you to study the slippage of concept which is beyond naming. Imagine having a tool that can deconstruct ontological orders asking for different kinds of readings.\n\nThe Multilingual Thesaurus for Medieval Studies (MLTMS) is that tool. MLTMS links terms, i.e. word-forms, with the same meaning, i.e. concept, in the core languages of contemporary studies of the Middle Ages. MLTMS enables scholars to search a variety of electronic resources in different languages at a conceptual level whilst being based on both common and technical word-forms in the major languages used by scholars and other interested parties. Cross-language retrieval of search-results is therefore possible from a number of query-languages. MLTMS is an open source reference tool available to producers of reference works in medieval studies, both large and small.\n",

Mellon Foundation](http://mellon.org/) which aims to engage scholars in designing tools for exploration, location, and analytic grouping of materials so they can routinely conduct computational scholarship at scale, based on meaningful worksets.\nMITH will work with Faculty Fellow Peter Mallios and the [Foreign Literatures in America](https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/research/fla/index.html) (FLA) team to develop a set of services and interfaces that will allow the FLA project (and other projects like it) to pull metadata records from the HathiTrust, correct and annotate these records using standardized vocabularies, gather corrections and annotations from other teams or scholars, and export enhanced metadata in formats suitable for publication as linked data. The design of this prototype application is intended to leverage the effort of scholars as they identify and select relevant resources from the HathiTrust corpus to create collections (“worksets”) useful for scholarly analyses. Mallios and the FLA team will experiment with using the prototype to continue their work studying the reception of foreign and immigrant authored literary works in the U.S., in interdisciplinary terms that encompass literature, culture, politics, history, and international relations.\nIn addition to leveraging previous collaborations with Mallios and FLA, this work builds directly on previous MITH work by Travis Brown, MITH Assistant Director of Research and Development, on a system for HathiTrust metadata correction developed by as part of a partnership between MITH and the [Princeton Prosody Archive](https://digitalhumanities.princeton.edu/ppa/).\n",

          "Stephanie develops, coordinates and implements digital research projects which foster collaborations between MITH and other library, archival, or cultural heritage organizations. This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of iotaCenter, a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions."

The project is committed to investigating the intersections between traditional humanities research and digital technologies. Begun with generous grants from The Newman Scholarship Fund at [University College Dublin](http://www.ucd.ie/) and [Enterprise Ireland](http://www.enterprise-ireland.ie/english.asp), it partnered with The Intents Project at University College Dublin to develop intelligent search and navigation tools for hyper documents. It is published by the [Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities](http://www.iath.virginia.edu/), at University of Virginia, and supported by the [University of Maryland Libraries](http://www.lib.umd.edu/).\n\nThe original goal of publishing an on-line bibliography of writings by and about Thomas MacGreevy is nearly complete, with over 400 texts that can be browsed or searched in a variety of ways.\n\nWith this release, the Archive now features several new collections available through the browse mode, including Thomas MacGreevy Composing a Poem, an edition of several of MacGreevy's poems that allows readers to trace their composition history; Thomas MacGreevy and Jack B Yeats: An Online Broadsheet, which explores MacGreevy's and Yeats's professional and personal relationship, and Who's Who in the MacGreevy Archive, a database which provides authority files for the names of people and organisations found in the texts. Many of the entries contain biographical notes.\n\nThe Thomas MacGreevy Archive is fully XML-compliant, with texts encoded according to the [Text Encoding Initiative guidelines](http://tei-c.org/). The Archive uses [Lucene](http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene) to deliver a majority of texts. The collection Thomas MacGreevy Composing a Poem utilises the [Versioning Machine](http://v-machine.org/), open-source software developed at MITH.\n",

Highlights included Katherine Hayle's keynote (nicely summarized at [jilltxt](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://jilltxt.net/?p=1992)), considering the idea of \"literary\" vs. \"literature\" and providing very intelligent close readings of a variety of works of electronic literature, readings from new works by Stephanie Strickland, Rob Kendall, Nick Montfort, Deena Larsen, and others, as well as three very good panel discussions. The process-intensive panel looked at the idea of process from several different angles ranging from process-intensive collaboration, to natural language interface processing, to story generation. The international panel featured demonstrations of electronic literature from around the world, including works in Spanish, French, Catalan, and Nordic languages, and also highlighted the fact that electronic literature is a global movement---ELO isn't the only organization concerned with this work, but has shared interests and opportunities for collaboration with organizations including [nt2](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://www.labo-nt2.uqam.ca/), [Elinor](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://elinor.nu/), [Hermeneia](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://www.uoc.edu/in3/hermeneia/cat/activitats/activitats.html), and others.\nThe Future of Electronic Literature panel was also an engaging discussion of how new technologies might effect electronic literature, and how new ways of organizing material and collaborating might effect the way that we shape the field.\nYou can see photos of the event, posted by [Scott Rettberg](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://www.flickr.com/photos/scottrettberg/sets/72157600185961028/), [Jason deVinney](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://www.flickr.com/photos/devinney/sets/72157600190099492/), and [Laura Borras](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://www.flickr.com/photos/8252982@N08/sets/72157600191451969/).\n\n### Symposium\n_Thu, May 3, 2007 _8:30 am -- 6:15 pm\\*\\*\n",

    "description": "Also called _Performative Experiments in Humanities Computing: Interactive Templates for Intuitive Learning and Research_, _Emily Dickinson: Technology and Mythobiography_ was a 2001 Faculty Fellowship project of Professor Carol Burbank from the Department of Theatre. Employing two different models of performative technology, a series of interactive templates for student experiments in writing, and a web collage or performance \"fugue,\" Dr. Burbank explored the way pastiche and narrative function within a technological frame. Both tools are were used in one of the University's Core courses, Theatre 110, to encourage functional, yet creative interfaces for scholarship and pedagogy through the use of inherently experiential theatrical and performance paradigms. Professor Burbank's work in this area has also greatly enhanced MITH's Digital Directions project, a three-week residential summer course for high school juniors.\n\nIn an [archived 2002 version of the project website](https://web.archive.org/web/20020302081244/http://www.mith.umd.edu/burbank/contradictions.html), Burbank describes the project thusly: \"Computer stagings, steeped in the experience of process, scripted in a collaboration between users and designers, could be a medium in which audiences become directors, or perhaps some hybrid between authors and 'spect/actors' to use Augusto Boal's term. If the computer user can become an active participant in critical self-invention and the negotiations of cultural identity, then we can begin to develop a new method of participatory theatre in which presence and immersion is rooted, not in the physical community of live theatre, but in the experience of manipulating images and creating an online community and an ongoing virtual site-specific performance space. In this space, interactive multimedia 'fugues' can serve as mirrors of critical and personal relationships with Emily Dickinson, staging the unconscious mythobiographical imperatives that twist our perceptions, and give us the pleasure of the poet's imaginary company.\"\n",

    "description": "Digital Diasporas was the first conference of its kind to bring together to discuss on-going projects and also debate the theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical issues raised by the intersection of the fields of Digital Humanities and African American/African Diaspora Studies.\nThe goal of the conference was to address the increasing centrality of digitization to the archiving of materials, as well as the growth of digital technology in the teaching, scholarship and artistic production in the field of African American/African Diaspora Studies.\nThe schedule included a keynote address by Abdul Alkalimat (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), workshops on text encoding and navigating online resources in African American and African Diaspora Studies, panels and seminars with scholars and funders, a digital \"poster\" session, a book fair, and multi-media art installations and performances by artists and local performers Pamela Z and DJ Spooky.\nOriginally a MITH Fellowship project of Zita Nunes, Associate Professor of English and Comparative Literature, this conference emerged as a full-blown collaboration between MITH and the African American / African Diaspora Area Group of the English Department. It was sponsored by various UMD departments, as well as institutions and scholars from across the US:\n- UMD Office of the Vice President of Research\n- UMD Office of the Associate Provost for Equity and Diversity\n- UMD Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH)\n- UMD English Department\n- UMD Offices of the Dean of Graduate Studies, Dean of Undergraduate Studies, and Dean of the Libraries\n- UMD Student Affairs Office\n- UMD David C. Driskell Center for the Study of the Visual Arts and Culture of African Americans and the African Diaspora\n- UMD Consortium on Race, Gender and Ethnicity\n- UMD Nyumburu Cultural Center\n- WMUC Radio 88.1\n- Johns Hopkins University Center for Africana Studies\n",

This series of meetings is made possible by generous funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\nThese day-long public rollouts informed digital humanities and sciences computing developers, curators of digital collections, and scholars using digital content about the W3C Open Annotation Community Group’s work. Topics included the Open Annotation Data Model, the W3C Open Annotation Community Group, existing implementations of Open Annotation producers and consumers, and developer tools and resources.\nAt the U.S. East Coast Rollout in May, MITH presented its [video annotation developer toolkit](http://umd-mith.github.com/OACVideoAnnotator/) developed in conjunction with [Alexander Street Press](http://alexanderstreet.com/). The toolkit provides a JavaScript framework for creating and viewing annotations of video embedded in a web page without having access to the video stream, enabling annotation of proprietary video. MITH also outlined its ongoing work developing a Drupal module that uses this toolkit to enable annotation of video embedded in a website.\n",

    "description": "_Infinite Ulysses_ was the 2014-15 Winnemore Digital Dissertation project of [Amanda Visconti,](../../people/person/amanda-visconti/index.html) who created a participatory digital edition of James Joyce's difficult but rewarding novel _Ulysses._ This project built on [her master's thesis work](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380) at the University of Michigan School of Information, where she explored user testing for the digital humanities, and how digital archives and editions might be designed to include a public audience.\nThe _Infinite Ulysses_ website creates a community for discussing the text; users can highlight sections of the text to add a comment, question, or interpretation, as well as read, upvote, and tag others' annotations. A variety of sorting, filtering, and toggling options customize the experience to an individual reader's needs, whether that reader knows Church Latin, wants to avoid spoilers, needs extra help as a first-time reader, or is a scholar studying _Ulysses_' puzzles or the function of written material (letters, poems, etc.) throughout the novel.\nAs part of her process, Visconti conducted user testing to gauge the [use, usefulness, and usability](http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/11/03/the3us/) of the edition. Digital editions are a key humanities scholarly form, but often we don't base our understanding of how they are read and used on data gathered through formal user testing. She used test and analytics data to support the speculative design of the edition as an \"infinite\" _Ulysses_ conversation. Could the site still produce customized reading experiences while storing an \"infinite\" quantity of annotations of various quality? What happens to complex texts---especially those authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic, like _Ulysses_---when a participatory digital edition places them under \"infinite\" annotations and conversations? Visconti gathered data on reading behavior---such as what pages of the book take users the longest to read, or receive the most annotations, or the most contentious (both up- and down-voted) annotations---as part of her research.\n",

We intend, as we develop an OCR correction system designed to create opportunities for users to improve the system and not just the text itself, to examine how explorations of a users' preferences can improve their engagement with corpora of materials.\n_The technological infrastructure for this project has been supported in part by a generous grant from [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/)._\n",

The DEA is produced by the Dickinson Editing Collective, with an executive editor, a general editor, two associate editors, a project manager, and a technical editor working collaboratively with one another and with numerous coeditors, staff, and users.\n\nThe Collective wants to portray Emily Dickinson, one of the United States' most admired and popular poets and beloved nineteenth century figures, first as a writer. We decided that the best way to do that, then, would be to show the writer at work; i.e., to display the handwritten records of her composing habits and her everyday writing routines. Although our goal is to edit and encode all of Dickinson's corpus, as well as all of the Dickinson family papers, we begin with a critical edition of Emily Dickinson's Correspondences. By gaining a more vivid and nuanced sense of the hand-to-hand circulation of her work that Dickinson and her contemporary readers witnessed, Dickinson's 21st century readers are likely to deepen and broaden understandings of her poetic project.\n\nInfluence is still an insufficiently examined field in the study of Dickinson's reception, and is vitally important to editing her writings: therefore, included here are writings by Susan Dickinson, Dickinson's most frequently addressed correspondent; Edward (Ned) Dickinson: Correspondence & Notebook; Titanic Operas: a Poet's Corner of Responses to Dickinson's Legacy; Titanic Operas: Poetry and New Materialities; and Contemporary Youth's Companion, featuring creative responses from high school and middle school students. Another section of the DEA is devoted to teaching practices, and features The Classroom Electric: Dickinson, Whitman, and American Culture, our co-production with the Walt Whitman Archive made possible by a generous grant from FIPSE (Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education).\n",

    "description": "The Digital Humanities Incubator is a collaboration between MITH and the University Libraries. The program intended to help introduce University of Maryland faculty, staff, and graduate assistants to digital humanities through a series of workshops, tutorials, “office hours,” and project consultations. In our first year (2013), the Incubator concentrated on working with UMD Libraries exclusively. Future iterations will include faculty, staff, and students from across campus.\n### Project Overview\nAcademic libraries are reinventing themselves in support of teaching, research, and public service, but organizational culture often conspires against meaningful reform. Fostering new opportunities for creativity and innovation itself requires innovation.\nParticipating in and supporting digital scholarship is a key strategic need for academic libraries as the materials and analytical practices of many disciplines become increasingly digital. Both collections and services must evolve in response. These changes require libraries to develop new skills among staff and to realign roles and work patterns.\nThe University of Maryland Libraries and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) have created a unique program to develop and train librarians in new, digital skills. This program, the Digital Humanities Incubator, has not only delivered practical training but it has also raised visibility of creative and enterprising opportunities for digital work across different divisions of organization and it has contributed to a far-reaching cultural change.\nParticipants in the Digital Humanities Incubator are guided through a series of workshops and exercises on the process of developing digital humanities project ideas, finding data, evaluating tools, and crafting a compelling proposal for internal or external funding. Skills learned in this program are grounded in participants’ own project ideas and interests, supported by brief in-depth lectures. The program thus offers a model for nurturing digitally engaged, research-intensive librarianship. With this training, librarians can reclaim roles as authors and leaders of the academic research mission of the university—marrying information organization and curation with scholarship and public engagement through the use of digital technologies.\nThe Incubator also contributes directly to librarians’ ability to act as subject liaisons with faculty. By understanding the project development process themselves, librarians can better communicate the potential of digital projects to faculty, help identify opportunities that integrate library collections, and enlist faculty and student researchers in joint projects. By engaging with faculty in this meaningful way—as practitioners trained in aspects of digital scholarship—librarians are increasing their value to the campus community and supporting the university’s mission.\nBeyond serving as a training program, an important function of the Incubator has been to foster an experimental culture in the Libraries. The Incubator model offers a safe place for librarians to brainstorm, learn, and grow and is but one example of a larger effort to provide an experimental culture that allows innovation to thrive. Many other solid examples exist within the University of Maryland Libraries. The Libraries’ work to engage stakeholders in an architectural redesign of the main library proved so successful the process is now a model for other campus-wide planning measures. The newly created Digital Stewardship Unit offers guidance and support for digital projects such as journal publishing. Librarians and others gather monthly over brown-bag lunches to teach each other about new programs, apps or resources they’ve discovered. The Incubator serves as a common ground where these and other internal activities such as the work of a task force on competencies for liaison librarians.\nThe workshop cycle consisted of four workshops, each held twice. Workshops on each topic were offered once in the morning and once in the afternoon on alternate days, spaced at least two days apart. This allowed part-time librarians, library division heads, and full-time reference/subject librarians to have the opportunity to attend without having to make special work arrangements. This also allowed for librarians to repeat the same workshop content to allow for differing types of learning styles. Librarians were able to attend the first workshop, listening and taking notes, then return for the second to ask questions and further understand what they might have missed the first time. This was particularly important for the “data” workshop where participants were encouraged to scrape, manipulate, and explore data in ways unfamiliar to most librarians but crucial to much digital humanities work.\nAdditionally, by interlacing office hours with each workshop, the instructional team was able to revise content, post answers to questions, and facilitate immediate interventions on the project level where needed. In part, this blended structure combining instruction with hands-on work with participants’ own project ideas allowed for quick implementation, demonstration of core concepts, discussion and reflection. Librarians attending without their own project were encouraged to join a colleague’s. This “learn and do” philosophy enabled collaboration across divisions in rewarding ways.\n### History of Development and Implementation\nThe University Libraries and MITH are longtime partners. With the university’s College of Arts and Humanities, the University Libraries have supported MITH since its founding in 1999. MITH, which can claim a successful string of digital humanities projects, made its home in the university’s main library until last year when it moved to spacious new offices in the special collections library. However, as MITH flourished—having secured funding from grantors including the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Science Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Library of Congress and the Institute for Museum and Library Services—its partnership with the University Libraries lapsed.\nFor example: MITH’s faculty fellowship program, geared to the needs of research faculty, did not meet the needs of librarians, who had little time or expertise to pursue their own digital initiatives. Only two projects out of over a dozen in the history of MITH’s fellowships have included librarians as primary investigators. Technology often outpaced librarians’ ability to leverage it. Furthermore, severe budget limitations (hiring freezes, state-imposed furloughs, and subsequent exodus of young talent) demoralized many and stifled innovative thinking.\nAs a first step in reinvigorating the partnership, in 2011 the University Libraries and MITH created and funded a joint position. The Assistant Dean for Digital Humanities Research at the University of Maryland Libraries, Trevor Muñoz, is also MITH’s Associate Director. He develops joint projects between MITH and the Libraries, coordinates activities and initiatives, and leads a digital scholarship strategy along with library colleagues. These activities have crystallized as a formal, annually revised charter between the Libraries and MITH that identifies roles, responsibilities and goals for each partner. As part of that charter, the partners committed to providing support to each other’s strategic goals. The library appointed a new liaison for digital humanities, Ms. Kelsey Corlett-Rivera, while MITH opened its project development and grant writing expertise to library divisions through consultations with Assistant Director Dr. Jennifer Guiliano. These small steps to develop capacity to have the partners’ expertise “on-call” set the stage for the development of the Digital Humanities Incubator.\n### Intended Clientele and Assessment\nThe Digital Humanities Incubator at Maryland has been targeted at academic librarians and staff who wish to gain new skills for developing, supporting, and leading digital projects. MITH previously supported individual faculty projects through a fellowship program targeted at the College of Arts and Humanities. Faculty within the College of Arts and Humanities generally are nine month long appointments and maintain a regular schedule of leave to support their research activities. Additionally, they have regular access to University resources to support their research. Librarians, on the other hand, while they can hold faculty status are employed twelve months of the year and do not receive university-level support for their research activities.\nFrom the beginning the Incubator was explicitly framed as an experiment to develop a more broad-based, programmatic collaboration between the Libraries and MITH. In order to assess the impact of the program, the Incubator’s directors solicited feedback from participants about their experiences. Quantitative and qualitative online surveys were distributed to librarians who participated. Assessment activities sought to explore not just the effect of the incubator on librarians’ knowledge of digital humanities methodologies and tools but also how the institutional partners (Libraries and MITH) could surface and support long-term research initiatives building on ideas first explored within the Incubator. As part of assessment, Mr. Muñoz and Dr. Guiliano also conducted individual consultations with 15 Incubator participants leading up to and following the fourth and final workshop in the series. These qualitative interviews allowed for revisions of workshop content, identification of potential projects and library partners, as well as the opportunity to identify additional resources needed from MITH and the University Libraries to support innovative librarianship.\nParticipants were encouraged but not required to “pitch” an idea for a digital project during the capstone event for the Incubator program. These short (5-minute) presentations drew on skills acquired during the Incubator, forcing participants to frame their research interests in terms of potential audiences, available technologies, and overall feasibility of timeframes and budgets. Thirteen librarians or teams of librarians participated in the “[pitch round](http://mith.umd.edu/community/dh-events/event/digital-humanities-incubator/)” during the capstone event. These presentations were evaluated by an audience of their peers from the Libraries as well as by the MITH staff. Five finalists were chosen to continue refining their proposals for a potential joint project with the MITH staff. Further joint work with MITH staff includes an additional six months of group work focusing on the creation of project prototypes and the development of a full-fledged project proposal for funding support. The selection of these “next-stage” projects was based on their potential innovation and alignment with the Libraries’ and MITH’s strategic goals.\nIn Spring of 2013, MITH extended offers to Lara Otis and Doug McElrath to serve as affiliated researchers at MITH for six months while they worked on their proposed projects. These two projects raised similar issues, had similar technical needs, and spoke interestingly to each other as potential digital resources about the changing American landscape.\nProposals not selected also generated new digital initiatives for the Libraries by being turned back to divisions that could assist in their development. These spin-off projects—one related to crowdsourcing and one related to acquisition of basic programming skills—will be further articulated with the assistance of the Libraries’ Digital Stewardship unit during 2013 – 14.\nBased on assessment of the program, the Digital Humanities Incubator will be sustained as a joint activity represented in the formal charter for the partnership between the Libraries and MITH. Content created as part of the Incubator series will be released under a Creative Commons license by the instructors for use by other institutions. Significantly, the University of Maryland Libraries have committed to 20% staff release time for librarians involved in at least one “next-stage” project librarian emerging from the Incubator. Additionally, Mr. Muñoz and Dr. Guiliano will be working with the Digital Stewardship Unit and MITH to train additional instructors in the Incubator series to offer additional workshops and training in future iterations so as to insulate the Incubator from disruption by administrative leave or other staffing changes among current personnel.\n",

          "Stephanie develops, coordinates and implements digital research projects which foster collaborations between MITH and other library, archival, or cultural heritage organizations. This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of iotaCenter, a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions."

    "description": "Also referred to as _Narratives of Creativity: Creating New Sites for Personal and Cross-Cultural Exploration_, this was a 2002 Faculty Fellowship project of Professor Carolina Robertson from the Ethnomusicology Department. Based on the core premise that creativity is not necessarily a state of grace rooted in innate talent or skill, a series of seminars were offered through the University's '[Teachers as Scholars](https://web.archive.org/web/20040511212856/http://www.arhu.umd.edu/outreach/tas/)' program, in which teacher participants explored their own life narratives as doorways to creativity against a backdrop of parallel stories from other cultures. Dr. Robertson worked with a MITH programmer to develop an interactive website with malleable texts, sounds and images as the dynamic outcome of this process.\n\nThe [project description found on the website (as of 2002)](https://web.archive.org/web/20030118091517/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/nth/index2.html) stated \"Each of us contains the innate right and ability to create, whether through the expressive arts or through other vehicles that allow us to imagine and manifest the life we want to live. This project addresses the creative process as it is framed and experienced in many cultures. The personal narratives that constitute the main corpus of data were gathered during three decades of field research in Ghana, Hawai'i, and Latin America. These stories reflect several themes or patterns identifying the journeys that have led the teller towards integrating creative processes into daily life.\n\nOur goal is to discover how we can clear out misconceptions and other obstacles in our own narratives that keep us from embracing our own creativity. Whether we are artists, physicists, actors, teachers, lawyers, writers, electricians, dancers, accountants, social activists, administrators, or musicians we can harness the forces in us that allow us to express aspects of being that cannot be accounted for in words and work. By opening and exploring these coffers we can create new life narratives in which we visualize, imagine, and manifest our full potential.\"\n",

    "description": "The **Building an Accessible Future for the Humanities Project** facilitated four two-day long workshops where humanists, librarians, information scientists, and cultural heritage professionals learned about technologies, design standards, and accessibility issues associated with the use of digital technologies. This important project was a partnership with the BrailleSC.org project, the Northeastern University Center for Digital Humanities, the Emory University Libraries Digital Commons (DiSC), the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH) at the University of Nebraska (UNL), and the College of Information at the University of Texas at Austin (UT).\nWhile scholars who offer courses have been able to turn to their University-level instructional technologies staff for accessibility, scholars who are designing, building, and implementing digital products outside of the classroom (as most humanities-research projects do) have been unable to get the help or guidance that they need. These types of research and the issues of accessibility that they raise with are not the same accessibility issues usually addressed by disability support services offices on university campuses. These campus resources generally concentrate on students and their engagement with course materials (exams and textbooks) or the physical environment (assistive devices). As a result, humanists, librarians, and others looking for assistance in building, designing, and implementing digital projects for assisted users have been largely ignored. Accessible Future will engage those working in digital humanities, information studies, librarianship, and cultural heritage work with resources, training, and a community of people that can assist them with accessibility issues in their own research, training, and teaching.\n",

    "description": "_Broadcasting Audiovisual Data_ is an initiative funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities to enhance discoverability of archival radio collections using a linked open data framework. A partnership between MITH and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the project is an expansion of the previous NEH-funded project _[Unlocking the Airwaves](https://mith.umd.edu/research/unlocking-the-airwaves/)_. While _Airwaves_ was centered on virtually reuniting one set of geographically separated collections, the National Association of Educational Broadcasters' (NAEB) paper and media collections, _Broadcasting A/V Data_ will connect the linked NAEB collections to three additional complementary collections of educational radio, community radio, and public radio history. These include [The National Federation of Community Broadcasters](https://www.lib.umd.edu/news/2018/08/nfcb) (NFCB) collections at UMD Libraries; the [Wisconsin Public Radio](https://www.library.wisc.edu/news/2019/05/17/uw-madison-archives-receives-clir-award-to-digitize-250-at-risk-recordings/) (WHA) collections at University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries; and the [WLB/KUOM collections](https://www.continuum.umn.edu/2019/10/u-libraries-receives-44000-for-radio-digitization/) at University of Minnesota Libraries. \n\nEducational and public broadcasting collections are a window into the history of the American experience. These collections are not just about unique content. They’re also about unique people and organizations. We’ll use those people and organizations as connective tissue between siloed collections of historic radio to promote new discoveries not just about the history of broadcasting, but about the history of how Americans shared their stories with each other during some of our nation’s most culturally tumultuous decades.\n\nMITH, UW-Madison and our content partners will also be building on the work of other national projects, including the [Social Networks and Archival Context Cooperative](https://portal.snaccooperative.org/about) (SNAC) project and [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), both of which increase context and discoverability for archival collections through the use of linked data and archival authority aggregation. We will also extend and augment workflows for creating new data endpoints for increased access to all four collections. This will include surfacing select people and organizations to Wikipedia, and the creation of 'linked open exhibits' with a team of scholars who will craft new scholarship made possible by the newly-linked collections.\n\nThe project will be a model for future initiatives that seek to connect and contextualize disbursed a/v collections, by innovating new workflows and methods for integrating archival collections data in a way that reaches diverse user groups, ranging from expert scholars to the general public. Linking these collections will enable robust research across a number of fields across the humanities, including media studies, cultural history, sociology, and more. \n",

It is the most authoritative source for the influence on non-Jewish culture upon Jewish culture during the Middle Ages. Although unrivaled and unsurpassed, Steinschneider's work is dated and in need of revision. The Steinschneider Bibliographical Database (SBD) includes a translation and ongoing update of HU, a comprehensive list of extant manuscripts in the relevant areas with pictures of the first folios of each manuscript, selected English translations (where available and permission is attainable), and links to further information. All the materials of the SBD is available for scholars digitally.\n\nWhile the SBD is geared primarily for scholars, it will have immediate pedagogic value in college courses and for Jewish high schools. Using the SBD, this project hopes to kindle interest among high school and college students in the study of the history of science and philosophy among the Jews.\n",

    "description": "The Digital Humanities Incubator is a program intended to help introduce University faculty, staff, and graduate assistants to digital humanities through a series of workshops, tutorials, \"office hours,\" and project consultations. Participants in the Digital Humanities Incubator are guided through a series of workshops and exercises on the process of developing digital humanities project ideas, finding data, evaluating tools, and crafting a compelling proposal for internal or external funding.\n\nThis first phase of the Incubator in 2012-13 concentrated on working with UMD Libraries faculty and staff exclusively. Academic libraries are reinventing themselves in support of teaching, research, and public service, but organizational culture often conspires against meaningful reform. Participating in and supporting digital scholarship is a key strategic need for academic libraries as the materials and analytical practices of many disciplines become increasingly digital. These changes require libraries to develop new skills among staff and to realign roles and work patterns.\n\nParticipants in the Digital Humanities Incubator were guided through a series of workshops and exercises. Skills learned in this program were grounded in participants' own project ideas and interests, supported by brief in-depth lectures. The program offered a model for nurturing digitally engaged, research-intensive librarianship. The Incubator also contributed directly to librarians' ability to act as subject liaisons with faculty. By understanding the project development process themselves, librarians were able to better communicate the potential of digital projects to faculty, help identify opportunities that integrate library collections, and enlist faculty and student researchers in joint projects.\n\nThe four workshops featured **1)** an Introduction to Digital Humanities, **2)** a workshop on developing your research ideas, **3)** a workshop on working with data, and **4)** project development best practices. Participants who attended the entire workshop sequence were guided through the process of developing digital humanities project ideas, finding data, evaluating tools, and crafting a compelling proposal for funding support (internal or external).\n\nThe second phase of DH Incubator, entitled \"[Researching Ferguson](../digital-humanities-incubator-2014-15-researching-ferguson/index.html),\" occurred in 2014-15 as a broader campus-wide initiative to provide leadership and training on event-based social media data and network analysis.\n\n### Workshop #1: Introduction to Digital Humanities\n\n_Wed, Aug 17, 2016_\n\n#### _[Description](../digital-humanities-incubator/index.html#123b38099403ee63a)_\n\n_\\*\\*NOTE\\*\\* This workshop was repeated on September 11,2012_\n\nWorkshop Goals:\n---------------\n\n-   Be conversant with contemporary definitions of DH\n-   Be aware of the scope & variety of DH approaches\n-   Understand the outlines of what work is involved in \"doing DH\"\n-   Be able to articulate some ideas for how DH might be applied in your librarianship, research, or service\n-   Be inspired to learn more\n\nPlan for the workshop:\n----------------------\n\n-   Orientation\n-   Introductions\n-   Defining digital humanities\n-   Survey of methods & projects\n-   Q&A\n-   Break\n-   Doing the work of DH\n-   The DH Incubator Program\n\n### Workshop #2: Developing Research Ideas\n\n_Tue, Oct 11, 2016 _11:30 am -- 12:30 pm _MITH Conference Room_\\*\\*\n\n#### _[Description](../digital-humanities-incubator/index.html#c7a069f205ef1688c)_\n\n_\\*\\*NOTE\\*\\* This workshop was repeated on October 15, 2012_\n\nPlan for the workshop:\n----------------------\n\n-   \"Research\" as an approach to your work\n-   The four parts of an idea\n-   Exercise: generating ideas\n-   Your ideas & the DH Incubator\n\n### Workshop #3: Preparing & Working with Data\n\n_Mon, Nov 12, 2012 _11:00 am -- 12:30 pm _MITH Conference Room_\\*\\*\n\n#### _[Description](../digital-humanities-incubator/index.html#171bff79d7df2d1bb)_\n\n_\\*\\*NOTE\\*\\* This workshop was repeated on November 15, 2012_\n\nPlan for the workshop:\n----------------------\n\n-   Data on the Web\n-   Hunting and Gathering (data dumps, screen scraping & web crawling, APIs)\n-   Searching & Sorting (operating system tools, programming languages)\n-   Structured Data\n-   Example/Case Study (data for topic modeling)\n\n### Workshop #4: Project Development Principles\n\n_Wed, Nov 28, 2012 _9:30 am -- 10:30 am _MITH Conference Room_\\*\\*\n\n#### _[Description](../digital-humanities-incubator/index.html#0fa38f331222232cb)_\n\n_\\*\\*NOTE\\*\\* This workshop was repeated on December 3, 2012_\n\n### Capstone Celebration\n\n_Mon, Dec 17, 2012 _1:00 pm -- 3:00 pm _MITH Conference Room_\\*\\*\n\n#### _[Description](../digital-humanities-incubator/index.html#e62ecc1064f4bb637)_\n\nJoin us for a capstone celebration & hear your colleagues' project proposals\n============================================================================\n\n### Monday, December 17, 1:00-3:00 PM\n\nThis year's round of the Digital Humanities Incubator workshop series is drawing to a close. To celebrate everyone's great work, MITH will be hosting a capstone event and party on **Monday, December 17, from 1:00-3:00 pm** (Hornbake 0301).\n\nLibrarians and staff who have participated in the Incubator process will present very brief \"project pitches\" describing their ideas for digital projects. In the spring, MITH will continue collaborating on the best of these proposals---to help create the first version of the digital project. We'll be hearing presentations from across every division of the Libraries. So, no matter which project is selected, this capstone event will be a great demonstration of the creativity and scholarship of Maryland librarians and staff.\n\n### Please, come join us and support your colleagues!\n\nCookies and light refreshments will be served.\n",

    "description": "The BitCurator project has been a joint effort led by the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (SILS) and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) to develop a system for collecting professionals that incorporates the functionality of many digital forensics tools.\nThere are already many cases of self-contained Linux-based packages that bundle many of the tools in order to support digital forensics activities. However, they are not very approachable to library/archives professionals in terms of interface and documentation.\nThere are two fundamental needs for collecting institutions that are not addressed by software designed for the digital forensics industry: incorporation into the workflow of archives/library ingest and collection management environments, and provision of public access to the data.\nTo address these needs, over phase one of the BitCurator project (October 2011 – September 2013), the BitCurator team developed the BitCurator environment, a highly customized version of Ubuntu Linux. The BitCurator environment includes a suite of open source digital forensics tools along with a custom interface that make these tools accessible to librarians and archivists working with digital media. Through the use of these tools, Libraries Archives and Museums (LAMs) can capture bit-for-bit copies of data contained on digital storage devices, scan digital holdings for sensitive information, generate technical metadata reports detailing the content of digital media, and more. Over the course of this development, the BitCurator team was advised by two groups of external partners: a [Professional Expert Panel](http://www.bitcurator.net/people/#pep) (PEP) of individuals who are at various levels of implementing digital forensics tools and methods in their collecting institutions, and a [Development Advisory Group](http://www.bitcurator.net/people/#dag) (DAG) of individuals who have significant experience with software development.\nPhase two of the BitCurator project (October 2013 – September 2014) continued the development of the BitCurator environment and, in addition, included a concerted outreach and engagement effort to build a sustaining BitCurator users community. These outreach and community building efforts were spearheaded by the BitCurator Community Lead who conducted both online and in-person BitCurator trainings at collecting institutions across the United States and Europe.\nNow at the conclusion of phase two, [the BitCurator Consortium](http://www.bitcurator.net/bitcurator-consortium/) (BCC) has been established as an independent, community-led membership association that will serve as the host and center of administrative, user and community support for the BitCurator environment. As a charter member of the BCC, MITH will continue to be an active partner in the BitCurator project as it enters the next phase of its development.\n_BitCurator has been funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation._\n",

The conference theme is \"Textual Embodiments,\" broadly construed. With this theme we will engage a range of issues involving the materiality of texts, including their physical, virtual, or performative manifestations as objects that can decay or break down and can potentially be repaired and sustained over time. It also concerns the processes of inclusion and exclusion through which bodies of texts take shape in the form of editions, archives, collections, and exhibition building, as well as the ethical responsibilities faced by textual scholars, archivists, conservationists, media archaeologists, digital resource creators, and cultural heritage professionals engaging in these processes.\n[Call for Papers](../../announcing-society-textual-scholarships-2017-call-papers/index.html) (due March 6, 2017) -- _CFP Closed_\n",

This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of iotaCenter, a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions."

    "description": "MONK was a digital environment designed to help humanities scholars discover and analyze patterns in the texts they study. It supported both micro analyses of the verbal texture of an individual text and macro analyses that let you locate texts in the context of a large document space consisting of hundreds or thousands of other texts. Shuttling between the \"micro\" and the \"macro\" was a distinctive feature of the MONK environment, where you may read as closely as you wish but can also practice many forms of what Franco Moretti has provocatively called \"distant reading.\"\n\nMONK stands for Metadata Offer New Knowledge, and metadata (data about data) are at the heart of its very radical \"divide and conquer\" strategy. For every document in a MONK environment there were explicitly recorded metadata at the top level (bibliographical data), at the bottom level of individual word occurrence (lexical, morphological, and syntactic data), and at the mid-level of discursive organization (chapters, scenes, stanzas, etc). This triple-decker structure of metadata helped to organize the MONK inventory of words in a collection. Visualization tools played a critical role in helping scholars both formulate the questions they want to ask and interpret the result sets their questions produce.\n\nAll code produced by the project is open source and is available for download. Public domain TEI texts (with MONK-added enhanced markup) that were used during the project are also available for download. Downloads (code and TEI) [can be found here](http://quest.library.illinois.edu/monk/project/downloads/). Be advised that newer versions of both code and TEI texts may be available elsewhere. The MONK download page provides a static snapshot of code and data as of the end of the active development phase of the project (2010).\n\nThe MONK Workbench is no longer available (as of the fall of 2013), but select algorithms from the Workbench and alternate plain text (OCR'd) digital instances of some of the works included in MONK are available via the HathiTrust Research Center Portal. Once you create an account on the HTRC Portal, you can log in and use the MONKmatch workset, or create and analyze your own workset.\n\nThe MONK project also maintained a wiki which included project documentation and a number reports and meeting summaries. [A portion of the wiki has been preserved here, and is available for browsing](https://apps.lis.illinois.edu/wiki/display/MONK/The+MONK+Project+Wiki).\n",

    "description": "This was a Spring 2007 MITH Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellowship project of Nadja Masura. Her dissertation, \"Digital Theatre,\" examined the ways that digital technology--such as animation, video, motion capture/sensing, and internet broadcasting--when used along with \"live\" co-present actors, expands our ideas of body, place, and community.\n\nDigital Theatre is a type of performance which utilizes both \"live\" actors and co-present audiences along with digital media to create a hybrid art form revitalizing theatre for contemporary audiences. This work surveys a wide range of digital performances (with \"live\" and digital elements, limited interactivity/participation and spoken words) and identifies the group collectively as Digital Theatre, an art form with the flexibility and reach of digital data and the sense of community found in \"live\" theatre. Masura offers performance examples from Mark Reaney, David Saltz, Troika Ranch, Gertrude Stein Repertory Theatre, Flying Karamazov Brothers, Talking Birds, Yacov Sharir, Studio Z, George Coates Performance Group, and ArtGrid. (The technologies utilized in performances include: video-conferencing, media projection, MIDI control, motion capture, VR animation, and AI). Rather than looking at these productions as isolated events, she identifies them as a movement and link the use of digital techniques to continuing theatrical tradition of utilizing new technologies on the stage. The work ties many of the aesthetic choices explored in theatrical past by the likes of Piscator, Svoboda, Craig, and in Bauhaus and Futurist movements. While it retains the essential qualities of public human connection and imaginative thought central to theatre, Digital Theatre can cause theatrical roles to merge as it extends the performer's body, expands our concept of place, and creates new models of global community.\n",

    "description": "Langston Terrace is the nation's first public housing program built in Washington, D.C. Opened in 1937, Langston Terrace housed Black low-income, working class families; it was one of 51 racially segregated projects built by the Public Works Administration as part of the New Deal. The architect, Hilyard Robinson, combined his experience as a native Washingtonian, his concern for housing solutions for low-income families, and his commitment to his race in this project. In so doing, Robinson followed in the tradition of the project's namesake, John Mercer Langston who served as the first Black American to serve in the United States Congress. John Mercer Langston represented Virginia in the House of Representatives. Hilyard Robinson, like Langston before him, advocated for social reform for Washington's poor residents.\n\nNestled on a naturally terraced site overlooking the Anacostia River, Langston Terrace stands at the corner of Benning Road and 21 Street, in Northeast. The initial complex housed 274 units; in 1965, 34 units were added just North of the original site. In 1987, the National Park Service recognized Langston Terrace's architectural and social significance by placing it on the National Register of Historic Places. This past summer, D.C. Preservation League placed Langston on its list of Most Endangered Places 2001 because of the neglect these historic structures have endured.\n\nIn collaboration with Kelly Quinn from UMD's Department of American Studies, MITH staff assisted with the creation of a website, Learning from Langston Terrace, which sought to commemorate the history of the community by compiling and offering primary sources for visitors.

    "description": "Foreign Literatures in America (FLA) is a project devoted to the recovery and understanding of the significance of foreign authored literary works, as well as immigrant authored literary works, in the U.S. throughout U.S. history.\nOur principal mission is to challenge conceptions of “American literature” that turn upon the American citizenship of an author—when historically it is clear that foreign authored works, as well as works by immigrant authors who wrote in many languages and were not citizens of the United States, have long profoundly constituted an important part of the literatures and cultures of the U.S.\nThis project thus seeks to offer many fresh opportunities to globalize the terms through which we understand American literature and American culture, both of these domains rediscovered as richly constituted and interpenetrated by global texts, concerns, contexts, voices.\nFLA pursues these goals by offering various means of studying the reception of foreign and immigrant authored literary works in the U.S., in interdisciplinary terms that encompass literature, culture, politics, history, and international relations.\n**Archival resources: **The project offers extensive archival resources of primary reception materials (i.e., accounts of “foreign” authors and works in newspapers, magazines, images, rarer archives, etc.) accessible in themselves, browsable in useful arrays, and searchable and subject to certain forms of quantitative analysis by nuanced means.\n**Laboratories:** The project develops laboratories based on cutting edge tools of machine learning drawn from recent digital humanities innovations in the areas of topics modeling and sentiment analysis; these laboratories allow users to mine large databases of “big data” already assembled for meaningful patterns and insights of literary reception.\n**Book review pages:** The project assembles its own smaller databases of book review pages from various U.S. newspapers and periodicals over time (beginning with the New York Times, The New Republic, and The Crisis), subject not only to the kind of searching and quantitative techniques of analysis found in the archival and laboratory sections, but also to comparative quantification of the most frequently mentioned authors in user-determined time frames and periodical ranges—(these book review pages thus become a powerful means of recovering forgotten literary and cultural history).\n**Collective Forum:** FLA is a committedly and internationally a collective forum for research, innovation, discussion, and collaboration, one in which blogging and various forms of collective interchange, suggestion, and crowd-sourced cooperation are facilitated—both as concerns all the research functions described above, and also toward innovation of further functions FLA could undertake.\nBeyond the general aims and specific outcomes noted above, there are two specific aims of this project that should be emphasized. First, in the shorter term, rather than do full comprehensive justice to any one of the functions described above, we are really trying to “open the door” with respect to them all, encouraging different teams of faculty and student researches both at the University of Maryland and around the country and world to develop dynamic possibilities for this project.\nAnyone interested in the kind of scholarly and analytic priorities foregrounded by the project is most warmly encouraged to contact us with your ideas and to join our project. The second point is more long term: though this project does aim to offer the means for a wholesale remapping of American literary studies (what this domain consists of, which voices and texts, why they are important), it is also a project of significance not only among university and academic research communities but also in larger social domains of education as well—including not only secondary schools and undergraduate pedagogy and also those interested in non-traditional education forms in our culture and society generally.\nThis general goal of making a productive globalizing contribution to American education in the broadest possible terms is an ultimate aspiration for this project.\n_The technological infrastructure for this project has been supported in part by a generous grant from [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/)._\n",

Scholars from the University of Maryland and the University of Nebraska will collaborate by uncovering the web of litigants, jurists, legal actors, and participants in this community, and by placing these family networks in the foreground of our interpretive framework of slavery and national formation. Focusing first on the landmark 1813 case Queen v. Hepburn, one of the earliest petitions for freedom from slavery heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, and a foundational case establishing the hearsay rule, the project will document the relationships within and among black and white families in early D.C. at the center of these cases, host virtual seminars to refine our methods, and produce a series of studies in monograph and article form.\n",

In this role, he provides management and strategic direction for MITH's portfolio of digital humanities research, community building, and teaching activities. His own current research is centered in a community-university collaborative dedicated to preserving and sharing the heritage of the historic African American community of Lakeland in College Park, Maryland, through community members' own voices.\nHis previous work has focused on humanities approaches to data curation, the strategic opportunities and challenges of doing digital humanities work within the institutional and cultural structures of academic research libraries, and on the design and sustainability of interdisciplinary research collaborations. Muñoz is a member of the founding team of the African American History and Culture and Digital Humanities (AADHum) Initiative and has served, since 2017, as a Co-Principal Investigator for the major grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation that supports AADHum. With Jennifer Guiliano, he serves as Co-Director of the Humanities Intensive Learning + Teaching (HILT) Institute.\nBefore assuming the full-time leadership role at MITH, Muñoz previously served as the center's Associate Director and also as Assistant Dean for Digital Humanities Research in the University of Maryland Libraries.

Ultimately this start-up grant will produce a work plan and report outlining a potential large-scale collaboration to map and explore the movement of Afro-Caribbean laborers between 1903 and 1920.\n",

Such staff members are not well accounted for by the normative division between the “research” usually associated with faculty positions and the “service” usually associated with staff. As a result, career trajectories and methods for their professional development are unclear. This Digital Humanities Level 1 Start Up grant supported a MITH-hosted two-day workshop during January 2011. The online discussion resulted in a white paper and a set of recommendations for establishing career paths within digital humanities centers.\n",

Extending the use of Anthologize—a free and open source plug‐in for WordPress that currently translates any RSS text into PDF, ePub, HTML, or TEI—MITH and the BrailleSC team will develop braille output for the tool.\nAs a result, BrailleSC will not only make it easy for content creators to convert a text into braille, thereby extending humanities content to hundreds of thousands of visually disabled readers, but will also experiment with making braille available visually through the WordPress interface.\n",

An artifact of great significance to cultural, religious, and social history, this text manifests itself in several forms dating roughly from the eleventh to the fifteenth century, including a significant 1492 printed edition. Led by Hayim Lapin, Ph.D., Robert H. Smith Professor of Jewish Studies and professor of History at the University of Maryland, the project will encode the text in TEI, in order to provide a research tool for the collation and comparison of text. Additionally, the database will include targeted searching, transcriptions, and an annotated translation for a wider audience.\n_The technological infrastructure for this project has been supported in part by a generous grant from [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/)._\n",

The goals of PVW2 were to help improve the capacity of libraries, museums, and archives to preserve computer games, virtual worlds, and interactive fiction. The work was funded by a $785,000 National Leadership Grant awarded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services.\nMITH’s research team played a major role in all aspects of the new project, including content analysis work, interviews with game players and producers, and conducting double-blind studies to help evaluate the “significant properties” of games and other interactive media. PVW2 was a novel methodology for studying the significant properties of video games and other complex interactive environments. By focusing on the temporal transitions between developer versions and player mods, PVW2 identified patterns of stability and change in game attributes–such as graphics, text, sound, items, and sprites–in order to help infer how different communities of practice interpret their relative significance.\n",

    "description": "Unlocking the Airwaves: Revitalizing an Early Public and Educational Radio Collection is a multi-institutional collaboration between MITH, the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://commarts.wisc.edu/), the [Wisconsin Historical Society](https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/), [University Libraries](http://www.lib.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland, with collaborative support from the [American Archive of Public Broadcasting](http://americanarchive.org/) at WGBH/Library of Congress, and the [Radio Preservation Task Force](https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-plan/about-this-program/radio-preservation-task-force/). The project is funded by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and is being directed at MITH by [Stephanie Sapienza](https://www.stephaniesapienza.com/) with UW-Madison Co-PI [Eric Hoyt.](http://erichoyt.org/)\nThe goal of the project is to create a comprehensive online collection of early educational public radio content from the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB). The forerunner of CPB and its arms, NPR and PBS, the NAEB served as the primary organizer, developer, and distributor for noncommercial broadcast production and analysis between 1925 and 1981. These broadcasts, mostly stemming from university and public school-run radio stations, provide an in-depth look at the engagements and events of American history, as they were broadcast to and received by the general public in the twentieth century. According to the project's Lead Advisor, Josh Shepperd of Catholic University and Director of the Radio Preservation Task Force:\n_\"The National Association of Educational Broadcasters recordings provide valuable context into cultural, political, and less-studied, educational discourses going back to the New Deal, and associated documents help media scholars to trace the origin of script development, audience research, and genres that we associate with both public media and cable television---science, travel, food, history, and journalism programming.\"_\nThe NAEB systematically preserved its history across over a hundred boxes of documents and 5,000 reels of tape, but the organization split its archive, depositing its papers in Wisconsin and the recordings in Maryland. Archival audiovisual media has been collected and maintained separately from other kinds of (primarily textual) archival sources, and these 'split' collections mean that researchers must often discover and manually reunite audiovisual collections and their related materials if they want to understand a broadcast not just as an audiovisual object, but as a medium that relays information within a set of historical contexts (time, place, related events, etc.). Unlocking the Airwaves will reunite the split NAEB collections, develop an open and comprehensive web portal for them, and tell the story of early educational and public broadcasting.\nBy coordinating the expertise of archivists, humanities researchers, and digital humanists, Unlocking the Airwaves will deliver enhanced access to important, mostly hidden, archival audiovisual materials by linking split hybrid paper/audiovisual collections together, and providing a search engine for the linked collections, enabling users to simultaneously search both the documents and sounds of the NAEB. The resulting resource will finally realize the potential of the collections of the NAEB for exploration and study by educators, scholars, journalists, documentarians, genealogists, and the broader public.\n",

          "Trevor Muñoz is the Director of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH). In this role, he provides management and strategic direction for MITH's portfolio of digital humanities research, community building, and teaching activities. His own current research is centered in a community-university collaborative dedicated to preserving and sharing the heritage of the historic African American community of Lakeland in College Park, Maryland, through community members' own voices.\nHis previous work has focused on humanities approaches to data curation, the strategic opportunities and challenges of doing digital humanities work within the institutional and cultural structures of academic research libraries, and on the design and sustainability of interdisciplinary research collaborations. Muñoz is a member of the founding team of the African American History and Culture and Digital Humanities (AADHum) Initiative and has served, since 2017, as a Co-Principal Investigator for the major grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation that supports AADHum. With Jennifer Guiliano, he serves as Co-Director of the Humanities Intensive Learning + Teaching (HILT) Institute.\nBefore assuming the full-time leadership role at MITH, Muñoz previously served as the center's Associate Director and also as Assistant Dean for Digital Humanities Research in the University of Maryland Libraries. Muñoz holds an MA in Digital Humanities from the Department of Digital Humanities at King’s College London and an MS in Library and Information Science from the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign."

    "description": "In January of 2013, the National Endowment of the Humanities (NEH) began a project to digitize all of its early grant records from the 1960's and 1970's. These records were stored on old punch-cards known as McBee edge-notched cards. Their goal was to get all these cards entered into a grants database by 2015, which was the NEH's 50th anniversary. In September of 2015, the NEH completed and announced the project. For the first time ever, the public could search for any grant the NEH had ever made. _Time_ magazine ran a story in which they featured ten of the old McBee cards.\nOne of these cards described a grant to Andy van Dam at Brown University in 1974. The title was \"An Experiment in Computer Based Education Using Hypertext.\" The brief description on the card simply said:\n_To support an experimental program to teach a college-level English poetry course, utilizing a new form of computer based \"manuscript,\" called a hypertext. A documentary film about the project is being produced. An evaluation is being performed to determine the usefulness of this technique as an aid to humanities education._\nThe short film that resulted is an early and remarkable document of the kind of collaboration between humanities scholars and students and computer scientists that is increasingly commonplace in the field known as Digital Humanities. It has not been shown in public since its making.\nThe Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities and the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/about/) at the University of Maryland, and the [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh) cordially invite you to its first public screening at **7:30pm on the evening of Monday April 25, 2016** in the auditorium at 0320 Tawes Hall. The screening will include commentary on this experiment, which built arguably the first online scholarly community, by Professor van Dam, followed by a panel discussion featuring van Dam as well as Maryland's own Ben Shneiderman, Kari Kraus (Associate Professor, iSchool and English Department), the NEH's CIO and Director of the Office of Digital Humanities Brett Bobley, and NEH's Program Analyst Ann Sneesby-Koch (to be moderated by MITH's Associate Director Matthew Kirschenbaum).\nWe hope that you can join us for this very special event!\n_Andy Van Dam will also be joining us for a special Digital Dialogue talk the following Tuesday afternoon, April 26th.

This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of iotaCenter, a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions."

    "description": "Enhancing Music Notation Addressability (EMA) originates from the idea that music notation, like text, can be \"addressed\" in new ways in a digital environment, allowing scholars to identify and name structures of various kinds. However, how can one virtually \"circle\" music notation? and how can a machine interpret this \"circling\" to retrieve music notation?\nTo research these questions, we are teaming up with the [Du Chemin: Lost Voices](http://digitalduchemin.org/) project (Haverford College), which is reconstructing songs printed by Nicholas Du Chemin between 1549 and 1568 in Paris. We will work on music analyses already produced by students and scholars as part of the Du Chemin project and re-model them as Linked Open Data nanopublications.\nIn the sciences, nanopublication is providing the research community with ways of managing attribution and documenting quality of even small contributions. The nanopublication model facilitates accurate citation and promotes massively collaborative scholarship. We seek to extend these benefits to humanities scholarship.\nEach EMA nanopublication will address an arbitrary portion of music notation encoded according to the [Music Encoding Initiative](http://music-encoding.org/home) (MEI) format. To support these addressing acts, we will develop a prototype application able to return a meaningful selection of encoded music notation.\n",

    "description": "African American History, Culture and Digital Humanities (AADHum) was awarded to the [College of Arts and Humanities](http://www.arhu.umd.edu/) (ARHU) and is being co-directed by MITH and the [Arts and Humanities Center for Synergy](http://arhusynergy.umd.edu/) (Center for Synergy). The project was funded by a $1.25 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for research, education and training at the intersections of digital humanities and African American studies, and will help to prepare a diverse community of scholars and students whose work will both broaden the reach of the digital humanities in African American history and cultural studies, and enrich humanities research with new methods, archives and tools.\nAADHum is built upon two of the University of Maryland's areas of internationally recognized excellence: African American history and cultural studies and digital humanities. The proposed project aims to strengthen both of these fields and offer new knowledge and understanding to scholars, students, cultural heritage professionals, and the public. African American history and cultural studies offers a broad landscape of research questions and archival collections relating to race and racialization that have not yet been widely engaged by the digital humanities. The thematic focus of the project, African American labor, migration and artistic expression, incorporates the broad intellectual interests shared by a large group of prominent scholars, students and staff on campus, and represents some of the campus's greatest strengths. Specific research projects will be undertaken in collaboration with [The Center for the History of the New America](http://newamerica.umd.edu/), which houses the Archive of Immigrant Voices; [The David C. Driskell Center for the Study of Visual Art and Culture of African Americans and the African Diaspora](http://www.driskellcenter.umd.edu/) with its collection of over 50,000 objects that chronicle the development and understanding of the study of African American visual culture; and the UMD libraries' recently acquired [George Meany Memorial AFL-CIO Archive](http://www.lib.umd.edu/special/collections/afl-cio), a preeminent research collection for the study of American labor history.\nAADHum will operate as a catalyst and a connector for scholars while providing concrete training and tools to project personnel, the wider UMD campus, and other institutions. The project will apply MITH's [Digital Humanities Incubator](../digital-humanities-incubator-2012-13/index.html) model to introduce scholars, students and cultural heritage professionals to new modes of research through a series of workshops, tutorials and detailed consultations. The goal of the Incubator framework is to organize the high-level training intended to acculturate scholars, students, and librarians to new modes of research, collaboration, and publishing across projects. The project team will work with the Driskell Center, CHNA, and the Meany Archives to identify small datasets from those collections focused on immigration and labor as testbeds for the initial Incubator, which will prepare the ground for such work by cultivating and vetting research questions that arise as our the collections are made tractable to digital tools and methods.\nThe Center for Synergy will provide an interdisciplinary bridge between departments and centers and facilitate the public facing events, curricular initiatives and websites connected with the project. This includes graduate and undergraduate courses, summer institutes for faculty to diversify and transform curricula, and themed seminar and speaker series.\n\n**Photo Credits:** \"Five generations on Smith's plantation, Beaufort, South Carolina\", Timothy O'Sullivan, 1862---Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress. _Power and Purpose_, 2008, Paper pulp painting, 49.5 x 97″, © 2013 Preston Sampson. 500 Laborers from Barbados/Deck Scene, September 2, 1909, Panama; NARA identification number 185-G-1128.\n",

She is currently working on a monograph about digital black feminism and new media technologies.\nSteele is the first Project Director of African American History, Culture and Digital Humanities (AADHum), for which she will lead up initiatives to prepare a diverse cadre of scholars and students whose work in African American History & Culture and the Digital Humanities will enrich arts and humanities research and teaching with new methods, archives, and tools."

This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of iotaCenter, a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions."

Together with the existing [Deena Larsen Collection](http://mith.umd.edu/larsen/), also housed at MITH, these two collections position MITH as a major center of study for anyone interested in primary source materials–both manuscript and born-digital–from this unique moment in literary and technological history.\nBly’s collection includes numerous exemplars of hypertext fiction and poetry collected over the years, as well as his own notes and variations for _We Descend_, his ongoing hyper-fiction, the first volume of which was published by Eastgate Systems in 1997. The collection is particularly rich in materials related to the early Macintosh software HyperCard, used as the platform for dozens of works of early electronic literature.\nMITH Associate Director Matthew Kirschenbaum says “We at MITH see Bill’s gift as a _living archive_, to be accessed, explored, and enjoyed as openly as possible by students and researchers. We will be working to catalog and describe the materials, and we welcome anyone with an interest in exploring the history of hypertext to contact us about a visit.”\n",

    "description": "_Thu, Nov 2, 2017 _\n1:30 pm - 4:30 pm\nMITH Conference Room\nUnderstanding the contents of institutional and digital collections and their connections to other related material can be daunting. Increasingly researchers, institutions and a broader public can work together, using crowdsourcing and linked open to meaningfully enrich and connect collections.\nThis panel and workshop, planned in conjunction with the [2017 Radio Preservation Task Force Conference](https://radiopreservation.org/), will focus on innovative workflows for crowdsourcing linked data to build a web of data that can bridge collective heritage. Both researchers interested in learning to access more information about radio collections and collection managers will benefit from this cross-disciplinary event.\nPanelists will discuss their work and research in crowdsourcing or linked open data for radio collections. Subsequently, a two-hour workshop will introduce the core principles behind the data structure and framework for Wikidata, and demonstrate how it can be used to connect archival radio collections to a broader web-based community of knowledge.\n_Moderator:_ [Stephanie Sapienza](../../index.html%3Fp=11177.html) (​Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities)\n## Panelists\n[Alex Stinson](https://twitter.com/sadads) (Wikimedia Foundation) will highlight how Wikidata is being used by diverse cultural heritage organizations around the world, including by the Archive of the Finnish Public Radio organization (Yle), the Social Network of Archival Collections (SNAC), and by other heritage organizations as diverse as the Metropolitan Museum and university libraries working to make their collections better connected with the world of linked open data through Wikidata.\n[Casey Davis Kaufman](https://twitter.com/CaseyEDavis1) and [Karen Cariani](https://twitter.com/kcariani) (WGBH Boston/American Archive for Public Broadcasting) will showcase the their IMLS-funded crowdsourcing project FIX IT, an online game that allows members of the public to help AAPB professional archivists improve the searchability and accessibility of more than 40,000 hours of digitized, historic public media content.\n[Eric Hoyt](https://twitter.com/HoytEric) (University of Wisconsin-Madison) will reflect on his work developing the Media History Digital Library's search platform, Lantern, and data mining application, Arclight. He will also discuss methods that users can use to translate their data into new queries and interpret and share the results.\n[Effie Kapsalis](https://twitter.com/digitaleffie) (Smithsonian Institution Archives): will share the Smithsonian Institution Archives' (SIA) methods for enriching and sharing their collections through crowdsourcing, with a particular focus on the institutional challenges of implementing such projects. Since 2005, SIA experimented with publishing minimum metadata about little-known women in the history of science, and recruiting constituents on various platforms (blogs, institutional websites, Flickr Commons, Wikipedia, Smithsonian Transcription Center) to fill in the 'unknowns.' These experiments have led to rich collections records on the Smithsonian's websites, complete Wikipedia articles, and improved digital resources on female scientists for the public. Today SIA is leading a pan-Smithsonian pilot to make a large contribution to Wikidata.\n## Workshop\nIn the workshop, we will provide a basic introduction to Wikidata and then use Wikidata to develop more robust context for an archival radio collection. We will connect Wikidata with authority records pulled from descriptive metadata about the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) collection at the University of Maryland/American Archive of Public Broadcasting. We will use that linked data to demonstrate visualizations and other potential applications of Wikidata for research, including unearthing other authority records and digital web resources about people, places, and other entities, showing network relationships between various metadata items, and asking questions to better understand the context of the collection.\n### About Wikidata\nA sister project of Wikipedia, Wikidata is a human and machine readable platform that allows for crowdsourcing to enrich metadata and access linked open data content from free and open vocabularies and data projects, such as the Getty vocabularies, the Social Network of Archival Content (SNAC), and others. Wikidata maintains many of the dynamics of the widely popular encyclopedia: it's free and open, editorial decisions are made by the community participating in the project, and the content is multilingual, supporting hundreds of languages.\n## Videos\n<iframe title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/242802386\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<iframe title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/242802386\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",

          "Stephanie develops, coordinates and implements digital research projects which foster collaborations between MITH and other library, archival, or cultural heritage organizations. This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of iotaCenter, a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions."

In addition to being a writer and thinker, Deena has also been a collector and an amateur archivist (or, as we say of amateurs, a hoarder). Collecting and hoarding, it turns out, are very important activities, since too few of our cultural institutions and repositories are yet engaged with acquiring and saving the rich and various creative legacy we have inherited from the first generation of personal computing. The arrival of Deena's collection at MITH furnishes us with invaluable source material which will further both our in-house research in digital curation and preservation, as well as function as a primary resource for researchers interested in early hypertext and electronic literature.\n",

    "description": "The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard is used by scholars to encode texts of many kinds, from manuscript transcriptions, to historical documents, linguistic corpora, and audio transcripts. For this reason, the vast standard is typically _customized_ before being used in a specific project (see our customization for the Shelley-Godwin Archive).\nThe TEI can be customized using the XML vocabulary from a dedicated module of the TEI (called ODD). To simplify this process, TEI users have relied for years on a dedicated PHP online tool called Roma. Raff Viglianti is rewriting this tool as a React/Redux web application to modernize the user experience, expand the features of the tool, and improve its chances for long term use and preservation.\nVisit the tool's GitHub repository (in the 'Links' section) to see previews and report issues.\n",
